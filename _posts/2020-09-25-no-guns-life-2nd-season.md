## Synopsis
>Juzo Inui’s next mission is to rescue Rosa McMahon, a girl who holds a valuable piece of data the Berühren Corporation is after. Still reeling from Colt’s death, Tetsuro swears to never hesitate again.And somewhere in the city, Pepper is determined to make Juzo her property along with her current Gun Slave Unit, Seven.

## Review
High hopes for this one, first season was a 8/10 for me. Feels good getting one of the best openings of the season, I am a bit biased towards Hiroyuki Sawano but whatever he makes is a masterpiece.

Tetsuro is so fucking useless and runs straight into a trap. Yikes, bad CGI outro with Mary twerking like a pawg. Why did they fuck it up so bad if they have a legend for a OP? Then again, the coomers are happy with it.

Topkek, the other guy was actally a woman with massive tits. The ending is also really lackluster.
   
The entire animation budget went into the boob jiggles and the outro 7/10
