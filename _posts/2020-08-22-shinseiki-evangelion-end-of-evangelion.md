>The End of Evangelion serves as an alternate ending to the polarizing final episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. With the fate of the universe hanging in the balance, the climactic final battle draws near.

## Review
After the last horrible recap Movie, I can only hope that this is something good.

Shinji is still a faggot but he grew some balls and fapped and coomed in front of Asuka which was in a coma. This is quite a good movie and explains lots of fillers of the main series. Asuka is also still acting like a brat and cries after her mom.

Before Misato died she revealed that she hated herself and gave Shinji the first and final kiss. Lots of people are dying, Akagi's plan to blow everything up failed as she got shot afterwards.

Asuka got basically picked apart by birds, went even more insane than before and died by getting pierced with spears. After Shinji learns of this he becomes insane as well and fucks shit up.

Rei's body falls apart and fucking Gendo dares to touch her, but she kinda ate his hand and become a big ass Human. Misato appears having sex in a vision/dream of Shinji. There a lots of fucked up moments and it is fun to watch, Shinji did the only right thing by choking Asuka, who wouldn't want to choke her?.

Everyone is melting getting touched by Rei. Basically everyone dies in a trippy way. The music in this movie is really good.
  
EoE is more gruesome and psychological than the series and offers a better conclusion. 8/10
