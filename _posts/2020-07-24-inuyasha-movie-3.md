Nice to see Inuyasha's father for once. We get to see some backstory of the three legendary swords, as well as a little bit of Inuyasha's mother. This movie has the best plot so far and delivers
some great action scenes, which are spread out through the entire movie. It feels a little bit more serious than previous entries and shows some more rivalry between Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, even Rin grew some courage.
   
I feel entertained watching this, more so than the earlier movies. 8/10
