## Synopsis
>Shiba Miyuki's classmate Kitayama Shizuku is on her way to study abroad. For magicians, this is normally impossible, since allowing the genes of someone who can use magic outside their home country's borders is tantamount to giving up national secrets. But it's allowed to happen in one case-exchange programs. And that's how Angelina Kudou Shields has arrived in Japan from the USNA to study at First High.
>
>Around the time Lina arrived in Japan magicians began getting attacked by a mysterious being who leaves his victims drained of blood. Will Tatsuya be able to discover the identity of the "Vampire"?

## Review
Really good opening!

Brocon is still the best girl all around and there were some cute moments. The entire premise around the parasites was quite dumb. A few days after the last parasite no one gave a fuck anymore. Which makes Linas character somewhat pointless.

Not sure how to feel about it but was a good time to watch it.
   
Could be better but ok 7/10
