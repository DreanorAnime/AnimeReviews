This one is about the Onmyoji Family and really shows how useless he his. It feels like watching a gacha game. I can't really say much about this, it is not that enjoyable to watch and gets boring pretty quick.
Cute little fangs are good but not when they are flesh instead of tooth...
  
Dunno what to feel but 6/10 because it builds up a little bit of backstory.
