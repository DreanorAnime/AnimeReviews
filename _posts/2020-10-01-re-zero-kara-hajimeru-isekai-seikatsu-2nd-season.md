## Synopsis
>Even after dying countless times, Subaru finally ended the threat of the White Whale and defeated the Witch Cult's Sin Archbishop representing sloth, Petelgeuse Romaneeconti. But only shortly after overcoming a tragic ending and reuniting with his beloved Emilia, Subaru learns that Rem has been erased from this world, having fallen victim to the White Whale's Fog of Elimination in the midst of Subaru's death loop. With the White Whale now gone, Subaru and Emilia are forced to confront a reality they never dreamed would happen.

## Review
Who's Rem?

Fuck man that pain of everyone forgetting about Rem is really bad. Lots of suffering and heartfelt moments like meeting his family again in the dream. All the witches are after his dick and want to save him.

Rem is probably a potato for 1-2 more seasons, pretty sad that she won't make much of a appearance. Roswaal is a dick and way more insane than before and the witches are insane as well but cute.
   
I need more of this 9/10
