## Synopsis
>The journey begins with Gon taking a series of bizarre tests to become a Hunter, which includes navigating a deadly jungle, hunting other applicants, killing a wild boar, an extraordinarily long underground marathon, and making sushi. During the Hunter Exam, Gon meets and befriends three of the applicants, Kurapika, Killua, and Leorio. The series' first antagonist is also introduced as one of the applicants. Hisoka is a complex villain who uses playing cards as weapons and views Gon as an "unripe fruit" that he will take great pleasure in killing once he's grown up enough to present a challenge. Before the end of the Hunter Exam, Killua faces his brother, Illumi, who makes him come home before he can even finish the exam.

## Review
Hold on a minute. His father left him when he was 12? Did he already fuck soneone as a 11 year old? How even?!

This is pretty good for a Shounen and it got me hooked right from the start. Killua is quite mysterious and I can't wait to watch more of it.
   
Really interesting. 8/10
