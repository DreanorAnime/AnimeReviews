## Synopsis
>When an Emishi village is attacked by a fierce demon boar, the young prince Ashitaka puts his life at stake to defend his tribe. With its dying breath, the beast curses the prince's arm, granting him demonic powers while gradually siphoning his life away. Instructed by the village elders to travel westward for a cure, Ashitaka arrives at Tatara, the Iron Town, where he finds himself embroiled in a fierce conflict: Lady Eboshi of Tatara, promoting constant deforestation, stands against Princess San and the sacred spirits of the forest, who are furious at the destruction brought by the humans. As the opposing forces of nature and mankind begin to clash in a desperate struggle for survival, Ashitaka attempts to seek harmony between the two, all the while battling the latent demon inside of him. Princess Mononoke is a tale depicting the connection of technology and nature, while showing the path to harmony that could be achieved by mutual acceptance.

## Review
I remember watching this every year around christmas as a child. Watching it now makes some things clearer.

It holds up really good even decades later, pretty amazing. Also holy fucking file size, almost 20 gigs for such a old movie. I don't remember it being that brutal kek. He is sniping heads and arms off, left and right like a madman.

Kodama look cute. Looking at the camp, Eboshi seems like Nobunaga. Waifu wolf is chewing food and taking care of him, cute little wolf.
   
A classic that still holds up to this day. 9/10
