## Review
Figuring out the Story Arcs is a pain in the ass. This is from Episode 157-170. The Opening and Ending this time are fine but nothing great like the ones before.

Can't belive it took a little bit over two years for it to come to an end. Charmy is the enemy of all the food of the Heart Kingdom. Asta looks buff as fuck now. Kek half of Golden Dawn got yeeted for good.

I can already see the big ass cliffhanger that leaves endless amount of things open and not finishes anything for the next couple of years and it makes me angry. Very good last fight of the anime, now we can just hope for a new season after the movie.
   
Really good and I want more 9/10
