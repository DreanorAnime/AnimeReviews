## Synopsis
>Hortensia Saga is a medieval fantasy tale of war and chaos. Three years ago, the king was betrayed and murdered by one of his dukes who then rebuilt the kingdom into his own. But now, the original heir to the throne has secretly come of age. Hiding in the guise of a man, she and her loyal band begin the quest to save her homeland.

## Review
First episode is a trainweck and makes no sense of anything.

Desu desu Maido desu~ That fucking knight can't even defeat a archer in a 1v1 melee. It is fucking boring and trash.
   
Fucking trainwreck 3/10
