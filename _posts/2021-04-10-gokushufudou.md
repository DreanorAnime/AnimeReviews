## Synopsis
>"Immortal Tatsu," the legendary yakuza who single-handedly defeated a rival gang with a lead pipe, is a name known to strike fear in both hardened police officers and vicious criminals. Soon after his sudden disappearance, he resurfaces with a slight change in profession. Now equipped with an apron, Tatsu has given up violence and is trying to make an honest living as a house husband.
>
>While adapting to mundane household tasks, Tatsu finds that being a house husband has its own challenges, from the battlefield known as supermarket sales to failures in the kitchen. Despite living peacefully, misunderstandings seem to follow him left and right. Gokushufudou follows the daily life of the comically serious ex-yakuza as he leaves behind his dangerous previous life to become a stay-at-home husband.

## Review
I absolutely love the manga, it was such a amazing read and it still goes on. Anime looks grim with only 5 episodes as a ONA.

Fuck netflix FUCKING CUCKS. Doesn't do the manga any good. This is more like the actual manga just in color without animation. Low effort and there is no fucking reason this should exist. Make something decent, the source material is so good.

The voice acting is good but really do stick to the manga.
   
I fucking despise netflix 6/10
