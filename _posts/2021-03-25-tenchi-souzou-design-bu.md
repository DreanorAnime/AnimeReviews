## Synopsis
>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. He also sought after a wide variety of animals to populate the planet. However, he felt that it was too tiresome to think of new ideas within his criteria. To address this problem, God appointed an organization—the Heaven's Design Team—to do the work instead!
>
>Shimoda is a newly-hired angel who serves as the mediator between God and the design team. As he steps into his role, he witnesses his coworkers conceive interesting ideas for many unique life forms according to God's desires. From giraffes and snakes to birds, anteaters, and everything in between, the possibilities for different animal species are endless!

## Review
Good laughs and actual facts about the animals that get created.

God is too lazy and outsourcs the creation of all kinds of animals with vague instructions to a team of angels. How each animal gets created is quite funny to see. The Queendom feels like propaganda by SJWs and the trannies... just fucking call it a Kingdom.
   
Fun and comfy 7/10
