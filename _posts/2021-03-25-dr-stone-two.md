## Review
Unga Bunga vs Science.

Obviously Unga Bunga looses, they built a fucking tank and throw nitroglycerin around. Unga Bunga did it all for his little sister which has been kept in loli form. That perfect hearing is also some bullshit to make the plot go in different directions. 

This season also comes with good op/ed songs. Into the freezer he goes kek.
   
Fun to watch 8/10
