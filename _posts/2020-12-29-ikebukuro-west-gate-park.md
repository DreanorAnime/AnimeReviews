## Synopsis
>Crime-ridden Ikebukuro is a haven for violent gangs, the Yakuza, and home to Makoto Majima. To protect his friends, this charismatic troubleshooter mediates disputes among the warring factionsâ€”even fixing problems the police can't.
>
>But when a rising tide of violence results in Makoto losing a loved one, can he ride out the storm, or will he drown in all the spilled blood that floods his streets?

## Review
First off, how the fuck is this romance? There is no romance at all between any major characters.

It is a huge self pat on the back for Ikebukuro. Basically Drrr! ripped off without any supernatural powers and any meaningful action that comes with it.

At least the episodes themself are somewhat enjoyable. 
   
Cheap Drrr! knockoff 6/10
