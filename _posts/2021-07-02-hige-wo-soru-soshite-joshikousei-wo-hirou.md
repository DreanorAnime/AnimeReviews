## Synopsis
>When regular salaryman Yoshida wakes up one Sunday morning after a long night at the bar, the last thing he expects to see is that his tiny apartment has a new resident—an unfamiliar high school girl.
>
>The previous night, despite finally gathering the courage to confess to his boss and longtime crush, Airi Gotou, Yoshida was rejected. After drowning his sorrows at a bar with his good friend Hashimoto, Yoshida headed back to his home in a drunken stupor, only to run into Sayu Ogiwara, a runaway high schooler. She asked him to let her stay the night, and with his judgment clouded by alcohol, Yoshida complied.
>
>Now, with his head on straight but with no memory of last night's events, Yoshida has Sayu explain just how she ended up sleeping at his apartment. Having listened to her story, Yoshida finds himself unable to kick her out—especially after learning that she came all the way from Hokkaido! So, despite his reservations about sheltering an underage girl, Yoshida allows her to stay, and their life together begins.

## Review
This just screams unrealistic. All the other guys fucked the brains out of the teen whore except this loner dude.

Why am I even watching this, biggest whore of the show, damaged goods that fucked everyone in sight for 6 months to get food and shelter. Imagine the smell of coom.

Woman programmer using visual studio in white, what the fuck man. Guy is simping hard for his female boss. After shaving somehow he became prince charming and everyone wants his dick.
   
Unrealistic and dumb at times, but somewhat ok 6/10
