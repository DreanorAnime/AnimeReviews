## Synopsis
>On his way to a convention, Yuan Ding, an otaku, finds himself transported to another world. A fantasy world with magic and demons. After failing the entrance exam at Shuo Yue Academy, he decides to become a gardener where he learns about the fairy seed. Yuan Ding's life in another world begins, aiming to collect the fairies said to exist in the legends to change his destiny and become the protagonist of this new world.

## Review
Started out interesting, but the story is all over the place. The pacing went from 0-100 after episode 1.

Character breaks 4th wall a lot with his meme episode count. Might've been more enjoyable if it had slower pacing. It basically is pervert collects fairy girls with a very weird story.
   
Wtf did I just watch?! 5/10
