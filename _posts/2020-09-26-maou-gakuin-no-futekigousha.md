## Synopsis
>After 2000 years have passed, the ruthless demon lord has just been reincarnated! But his aptitude at an academy for nurturing candidates for demon lords is, “inept”!?
>
>Having the capability to destroy humans, elementals, and gods, after a long period of countless wars and strife, Arnos the demon lord became sick and tired of all that and longed for a peaceful world, so he decided to reincarnate to the future.
>
>However, what awaited him after his reincarnation is a world too used to peace that his descendants became too weak due to a huge weakening in magical powers.

## Review
The harem elements surrounding Anos are great, the only thing that is really lacking is his two main waifus fused into one. They had one simple job of showing them with him but nope.

Fucking humans are retarded as always and old a grudge for 2000 years, demons are way better in this regard. The magical camera for that one scene is also pretty pepega.
   
Nice concept of the Demon Lord and Hero working together 8/10
