## Synopsis
>On her way home from school, Yukari Hayasaka is approached by a weird-looking guy who starts looking at her body intently. He's got blond spiky hair, a spiked choker, and multiple piercings on his ears and face. She wants nothing to do with him, and runs away, only to bump into a very tall and beautiful purple-haired woman with a flower pattern around her eye. Yukari faints from shock and wakes up later in a strange place called the Atelier. It turns out that these strangers are fashion designers who attend the most famous art school around, Yazawa Art Academy, and their group wants Yukari to model for their brand in Yazawa Academy's upcoming show.
>
>Yukari turns down their offer and escapes the Atelier, but unknowingly leaves her school ID behind. George Koizumi, the head designer, later sees it and immediately knows she would be the perfect model for them and will not stop until he gets what he wants—and he wants her. Yukari had never considered something as frivolous as modeling before, but could life among these eccentric designers actually prove to be fun? Or will Yukari lose herself in this world of art and passion?

## Review
She look good before but what the fuck is this stuck up bitch look after the first haircut and makeup.

All these niggers with paper clips as piercings should really fucking kill themself. It just looks retarded and cringe. The music is pretty comfy.

Surprisingly the official website run out and someone baguette bought it, never seen that happen to anime that isn't extremely old. This one is just from 2005.

High piched whaman is a whore. She looks retarded and probably got groomed by the punk. Yukari is pretty cute as a model, then again she is a whore as well, gives her virginity to the first guy she sees.

Goerge is a chad, gets home and the first the he does is fuck his girlfriend. Having Isabella be a tranny is pretty pointless and serves no purpose for this show. You will never be a real woman. You have no womb, you have no ovaries, you have no eggs. You are a homosexual man twisted by drugs and surgery into a crude mockery of nature’s perfection.

Everything lived up for that dress in the end and they didn't even fully show it in one big shot. What a fucking waste. That faggot must like getting cucked, his dream girl got fucked by some faggot designer over and over again and he ends up marrying used goods.
   
Overhyped because of sex and tranny 6/10
