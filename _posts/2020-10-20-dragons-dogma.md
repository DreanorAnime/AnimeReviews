## Synopsis
>Based on a world-famous action RPG set in an open world, Dragon's Dogma from Capcom will be brought to life as a Netflix original anime series. The story follows a man's journey seeking revenge on a dragon who stole his heart. On his way, the man is brought back to life as an "Arisen." An action adventure about a man challenged by demons who represent the seven deadly sins of humans.

## Review
The CGI looks pretty bad, the characters are okay but all the monsters and the dragons look like shit. Also most of the backgrounds look out of place at times.

I like this dragon, he goes apeshit on the entire town but spares one guy which is now bathed in hatred. Pretty cool that the episodes follow the seven sins. Whaman gets almost raped by the goblins and her husband is a manlet that can't do shit. Then once he actually tries and kills goblins he kills his wife and himself.

Damn imagine the coom smell mixed with weed in that one tent, must reek like no tomorrow. That woman is also pretty dumb to let her boyfriend fuck anyone. Now she is blind after getting eaten by the hydra, pretty useless what she did tbh.

   
Did not expect that Ethan becomes the next dragon 8/10
