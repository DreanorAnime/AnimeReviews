## Synopsis
>Through their tutor Fuutarou Uesugi's diligent guidance, the Nakano quintuplets' academic performance shows signs of improvement, even if their path to graduation is still rocky. However, as they continue to cause various situations that delay any actual tutoring, Fuutarou becomes increasingly involved with their personal lives, further complicating their relationship with each other.
>
>On another note, Fuutarou slowly begins to realize the existence of a possible connection between him and the past he believes to have shared with one of the five girls. With everyone's feelings beginning to develop and overlap, will they be able to keep their bond strictly to that of a teacher and his studentsâ€”or will it mature into something else entirely?

## Review
Based Uesugi with his random hitler face.

Ichika is still a fucking bitch. Miku is pure and the best girl, everyone else is just scheming or a bitch in some way or another.
   
Miku <3 7/10
