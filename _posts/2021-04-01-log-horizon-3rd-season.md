## Synopsis
>Third season of Log Horizon.

## Review
Took 6 years but here we are with the 3rd season!

Pretty good OP with BAND-MAID. The battle BGM reminds me of Fairy Tail. Fuck these subs, why the fuck do you translate honorifics into baby and miss, fucking nigger translators.

It was a good watch but it feels like that it lost some of it charm from the first two seasons.
   
Good but 6 long years 8/10
