## Synopsis
>In 1950s Japan, Tatsuo Kusakabe relocates himself and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei, to the countryside to be closer to their mother, who is hospitalized due to long-term illness. As the girls grow acquainted with rural life, Mei encounters a small, bunny-like creature in the yard one day. Chasing it into the forest, she finds "Totoro"â€”a giant, mystical forest spirit whom she soon befriends. Before long, Satsuki too meets Totoro, and the two girls suddenly find their lives filled with magical adventures in nature and fantastical creatures of the woods.

## Review
This features a big Owl dude with a leaf on his head.

Fucking kids are annoying. Someone should slit their throats so say stop screaming all the damn time, this is the most obnoxious part about this movie. Mei just killed a dustbunny like it is nothing. The first half an hour is boring character introductions and nothing really happens until a mysterious furry little guy shows up.

The background music is pretty good. Totoro sure does love the rain and the sounds it makes. That is one trippy cat bus. I don't get it, Totoro gets screen time for about 20 minutes, does some tricks and fucks off again how are people praising this as a godly movie? Is it really all fanboys and nostalgia folks? Definitely got its ratings from all the normies.
   
It took close to an hour for things to get actually interesting. 7/10
