## Synopsis
>A compilation movie of the TV series containing a newly added footage.

## Review
This is not worth it to watch.

There are only 15 minutes of new animation, 3 new MMD songs and some little tweaks that are barely noticeable. The rest of it is just the series squeezed into an hour with all the most important lewd scenes.
   
Feels like a waste and recap movies are always garbage but at least this one has better quality 4/10
