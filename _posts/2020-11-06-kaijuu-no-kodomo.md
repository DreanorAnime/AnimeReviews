## Synopsis
>When Ruka was younger, she saw a ghost in the water at the aquarium where her dad works. Now she feels drawn toward the aquarium and the two mysterious boys she meets there, Umi and Sora. They were raised by dugongs and hear the same strange calls from the sea as she does.
>
>Ruka's dad and the other adults who work at the aquarium are only distantly aware of what the children are experiencing as they get caught up in the mystery of the worldwide disappearance of the oceans' fish.

## Review
Very nice format, looks good on widescreen.

But that is almost where it stops, the characters look like shit, there is just no depth. There is no reason to praise it because of artistic bullshit. If it doesn't look pleasing it is shit and failed.

Bushniggers only entertainment is the aquarium. Let me get this right, a nigger got raised by dugongs and suddenly became like a fish and can breath and talk underwater. This makes no god damn sense and as a mystery it just seems plain mentally retarded.

The boys are pretty fucking gay. Better not show this to kids or they start turning gay. There is so much shit going on I can't even put it into words.
   
Shit artstyle and not that interesting to watch 5/10
