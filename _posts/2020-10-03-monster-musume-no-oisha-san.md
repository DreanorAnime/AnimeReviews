## Synopsis
>In the town of Lindworm where monsters and humans coexist, Dr. Glenn runs an exemplary medical clinic for monster girls with his lamia assistant, Sapphee. Whether receiving a marriage proposal by a centaur injured in battle, palpating the injury of a mermaid, or suturing the delicate wounds of a flesh golem, Dr. Glenn performs his job with grace and confidence. But when an unsavory character seeks to steal a harpy egg, how will the unflappable Dr. Glenn respond...?

## Review
This has to be the best job, being a doctor for monster girls.

Mermaid gets fingered in the gills and enjoys it, Lorna is a masochist, the spider is always plotting something, slimes are fucking disgusting in this. Pretty nice story and pacing over all and it has some good lewd moments.

I'd rank the girls as following: Dragon loli > Lamia > Cyclops >  Mermaid > Flesh Golem > Cat > Harpy > Spooder > Horse > Giant > Slime
   
Dragon waifu is the best waifu she is just too damn cute 9/10
