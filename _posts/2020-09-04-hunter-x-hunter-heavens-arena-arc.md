## Synopsis
>Gon and Killua go to Heavens Arena, a 251-floor building where people compete through fighting tournaments around the clock for cash. It is here they meet the Kung-Fu master Wing, who teaches them about Nen, a chi-like energy that can be used to manifest superhuman powers. He teaches a young child named Zushi, who joins Gon and Killua to fight in the tournament to gain money and experience. Hisoka is also in the tournament. Gon finally gets to battle Hisoka again, to show off how much he has improved.

## Review
Time for the battle tower!

The auras are a nice addition to the normal fighting. It gives the hunters some interesting abilities to fight with. Zushi is really pointless as a character, he only exists to compare against Gon and Killua to show how amazing they are and how quickly they learn the techniques.

Hisoka is still unbeatable with his powers. Nice fighting arc though, will they ever use the money they gained?
   
Good fighting tournament arc 8/10
