## Synopsis
>The anime centers on four girls at the full bloom of their youth, working hard to achieve their dreams as they struggle valiantly. In Japanese entertainment, Maesetsu! refers to an introductory talk or explanation addressed to the audience before the broadcast of television programs, usually performed by assistant directors and particularly comedians in variety or comedy shows.

## Review
Japanese Comedy is not for everyone and certainly not for me.

This anime does a poor job of conveying it. The girls are nothing special and it feels like a true waste to watch it.
   
Mediocre 3/10
