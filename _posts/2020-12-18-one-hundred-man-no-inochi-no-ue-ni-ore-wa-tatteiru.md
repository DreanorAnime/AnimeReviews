## Synopsis
>Yotsuya Yuusuke along with his classmates Shindou Iu and Hakozaki Kusue have been transported to a strange and unknown world inhabited by mythological creatures. As soon as they arrive, they meet somebody calling himself the Game Master who then grants them a time-limited quest. To aid them in this quest, he also bestows Shindou and Hakozaki with the roles of a Magician and a Warrior while Yotsuya is randomly granted the role of... a Farmer?!
>
>This is how a hectic life of adventuring began for three students who now have no choice, but to complete random quests for several phases in the fantasy world if they want to stay alive and protect the real world from the demons and monsters they encounter.

## Review
Feels weird watching a anime which I have recently read the manga on. Like everything is already spoiled.

The opening is pretty solid. Good start into the fall season.

Seems like a normal isekai, same formular all over again with nothing too intersting. Even dying is pointless when one can hide and everyone resurrects. It gets a little bit better later on but still seems too generic and somewhat boring. At least the male MC is not a faggot.

Fuck magical girls, that new opening gave me cancer and is just cringe. I'd rather neck myself than being forced to watch magical garbage. Most useless character somehow survives because of her neet obsession.

Based loli alien. The last episode and ending was shit. Season 2 might get better now that the MC seems more badass.
   
Kinda meh at times but good enough to watch 6/10
