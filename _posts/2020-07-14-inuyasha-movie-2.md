Damn, Kirara looks like shit in this one. This feels weird, kinda boring compared to the first movie, but it has some reedeming moments here and there. 
At first it seems that Naraku is dead but that is not the case towards the end.
The pacing is pretty meh and drags way too long. They really tried a lot to push the romance between Inuyasha and Kagome. Also the kiss that turned him back.
   
No particular feelings here. 6/10
