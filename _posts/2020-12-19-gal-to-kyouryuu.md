## Synopsis
>Wasted from the night before, Kaede wakes up the next morning to find herself at home with a dinosaur she had brought along with her. The two start living together as an odd pair consisting of a typical gal girl and a mute dinosaur going about daily lives. Although not the most experienced paleontologist, Kaede begins to learn more about her new prehistoric roommate through a series of comedic gags and adventures.

## Review
The creators should be shot for this absolute waste of energy and garbage. 

Why is this even a thing? How braindamaged do you have to be to create such a mess. It's a show for literal toddlers. At this point I know every author using badly drawn dinosaur or reptile as the cute mascot is just an asshole or sociopath.

This is by far the worst thing I have seen in the last decade. Not worth a single minute of your time. How is this even considered anime with live action bullshit.
   
Burn this shit and kill yourself 1/10
