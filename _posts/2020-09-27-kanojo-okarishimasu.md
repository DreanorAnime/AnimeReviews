## Synopsis
>Kazuya Kinoshita is a 20-year-old college student who has a wonderful girlfriend: the bright and sunny Mami Nanami. But suddenly, he doesn't. Without warning, Mami breaks up with him, leaving him utterly heartbroken and lonely. Seeking to soothe the pain, he hires a rental girlfriend through an online app. His partner is Chizuru Mizuhara, who through her unparalleled beauty and cute demeanor, manages to gain Kazuya's affection.
>
>But after reading similar experiences other customers had had with Chizuru, Kazuya believes her warm smile and caring personality were all just an act to toy with his heart, and he rates her poorly. Aggravated, Chizuru lambastes him for his shameless hypocrisy, revealing her true pert and hot-tempered self. This one-sided exchange is cut short, however, when Kazuya finds out that his grandmother has collapsed.
>
>They dash toward the hospital and find Kazuya's grandmother already in good condition. Baffled by Chizuru's presence, she asks who this girl might be. On impulse, Kazuya promptly declares that they are lovers, forcing Chizuru to play the part. But with Kazuya still hung up on his previous relationship with Mami, how long can this difficult client and reluctant rental girlfriend keep up their act?

## Review
Girlfriend broke up with him, making him seek out a rental girlfriend in the first place. She was a big bitch to him during that mixer with his friends and is manipulative and jealous just because he moved on.

Imagine getting the same hooker all the time and then falling in love with her, all the while not having sex or physical contact but still paying. Kazuya is the ultimate simp. Also topkek on them living next to each other. Kazuya is pretty pathetic clinging on to the first rental girlfriend while still fapping to his ex.

Might be one of the trashiest shows this season. At least the grandmothers are cute for acting like teens and having sleepovers. I can't even begin to imagine the smell of his room full of coom.
  
Overall not really enjoyable and cringe at times 5/10
