## Synopsis
>Second season of Otona no Bouguya-san.

## Review
Director is still a hentai.

Not long enough and pointless to enjoy. In 6 minutes runtime per episode you get half of it with unfunny chit chat and pink nosebleeds, the other half is a pointless movie plotline.

The intro might be the best part about the entire anime...
   
Trap elf is cute 5/10
