## Synopsis
>Within the horse-racing world, the horse girls of Team Spica have been gaining popularity as they continue to rack up victories. The one receiving the most attention in the group is Tokai Teio, known for her cheerful personality and exceptional running skills. Teio aims to become an undefeated Triple Crown horse girl by winning all three G1 races consecutively, a feat that has not been accomplished since the legendary Symboli Rudolf managed to do so many years ago.
>
>On her path to obtaining the Triple Crown, Teio is met with many challenges, encountering both old and new rivals. Amidst her fierce rivalries, however, Teio is soon confronted with decisions that will leave a huge impact on her very own racing career.


## Review
Tokai Teio arc.

Where is the realism where the horses get drugged and killed if they lose? Where is the betting? Same shit as always, kinda boring nothing exciting really happens. It is just to mundane.
   
Meh Teio isn't even best girl 5/10
