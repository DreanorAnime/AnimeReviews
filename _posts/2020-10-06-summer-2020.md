My Review of everything I watched this season. Spoilers ahead! This doesn't sound like a strong season, but seeing that there is more of RE:Zero and Fox Spirit Matchmaker makes me happy.

## Best OP/ED ##
Not every season has good and enjoyable music, this has quite a few. These are my top OP/EDs of this season. I even found a few new bands to listen to:

**No Guns Life 2nd Season - [Chaos Drifters Hiroyuki Sawano]**  
This is by far the best one, I just love everything Hiroyuki Sawano creates. It also really fits for this anime.  

**SAO: Alicization War of Underworld 2nd Season - [ReoNa - ANIMA]**  
SAO always had high quality and good sounding music, this is no exception.

**Fruits Basket 2nd Season - [AmPm / プリズム feat. みゆな]**  
The comfiest opening of the entire season, it makes you feel relaxed if you listen to it. Hidden gem from a band I didn't know before.

**Fugou Keiji: Balance:Unlimited [SixTONES - NAVIGATOR] and [OKAMOTO'S Welcome My Friend]**  
Both the opening (SixTONES - NAVIGATOR) and ending (OKAMOTO'S Welcome My Friend) are quite catchy and good to listen to, I think it is pretty rare to find a anime with both that are good.

**The God of High School - [Ksuke Ft. Tyler Carter - Contradiction]**  
Good upbeat song that is fitting for a fighting anime. I listened to it before and was quite surprised to see it here.  

## Best of the entire season ##  
It is hard to decide what was the best this season, but I tend towards [Fruits Basket](https://dreanoranime.github.io/AnimeReviews/fruits-basket-2nd-season/). On the other hand [Re:Zero](https://dreanoranime.github.io/AnimeReviews/re-zero-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsu-2nd-season/) was very close to being better but not quite as much.
