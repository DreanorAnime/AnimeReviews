## Synopsis
>OVA included with the special edition of volume two of the Blu-ray release.

## Review
Sandniggers still get triggered because of the OP, guess what fuck you no one cares.

This OVA is made with minimal animation, just barely enough to see the characters move their lips. There is no actual story, it just gives some backstory on the world and it's characters.

Episode 1 is about the sorcerer masks, Episode 2 is about Nikaido's gyoza shop, Episode 3 is about Ebisu wanting to have a picture, Episode 4 is about the Gyoza Fairy, Episode 5 is about En and his misunderstanding about the Masquerade Ball and finally Episode 6 is a how to video on how to mnake Gyoza.
   
It shows some backstory and triggers the sandniggers 7/10
