## Synopsis
>Gon, Killua, and Leorio return to help Kurapika’s recovery after the battle against the Phantom Troupe. Leorio and Kurapika leave again, returning the focus to Gon and Killua. Gon and Killua are able to join a team hired by the billionaire, Battera, to play the game. Gon and Killua are joined and later Nen-trained by Biscuit Krueger, a 57-year-old woman who looks like a 12-year-old girl, and is a master and experienced teacher of Nen. As the story progresses, a player nicknamed the Bomber is blowing other players up. Gon, Killua, and Biscuit team up with other players and take the Bomber out. The Phantom Troupe also travels to Greed Island, looking for a Nen-remover to remove the Nen blade on Chrollo Lucilfer, put by Kurapika to null his powers.

## Review
Now we finally get to see what Greed Island is all about, the last arc teased it a little bit before going down the Phantom Troupe story.

Greed Island is pretty interesting, a island in the real world where people get teleported to and collect trading cards. The 57 year old loli is a nice addition as a master. This arcs main villain is pretty dumb, the bomber might have a leathal ability but it feels just lackluster, Razor or another GM would have been way better to end things.

Hisoka is actually quite decent if he gets into his team spirit.
   
Interesting concept with a RPG like island 9/10
