## Synopsis
>The film will revolve around a mystery that happens on the day of the "Justice Day" festival that celebrates Sternbild's legendary goddess.

## Review
All the 2nd generation Heroes are useless as fuck and Kotetsu isn't that much better with his 1 minute that he has left of his power.

The animation seems a bit off and worse than the series. This time around we see more from Kotetsu instead of Bunny. Fire faggot got stuck into a gay ass trauma, fuck Animate and Dominos to sponsor a faggot nigger. 

Not much else to say tbh, new boss is retarded and corrupted and gets what he deserves.
   
Not much changed and the new hero is a asshat 6/10
