It's been a while. Drifters has been a very good anime and I have high hopes for it to continue that way. Hearing the Opening after so long really builds up what is about to come.
The Dark Knight finally shows some more battles and kills whatever is in his way with his army. It is as grim as always and very interesting to watch. The subplot with Kannon wasn't all that great and could've been spent better on the ongoing invasion.
  
I can't wait for the next season. 7/10
