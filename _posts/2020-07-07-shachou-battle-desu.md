My Company President Can't Be This Cute. MC looks like a girl and a little bit like the girl from Kimi no Na wa, but is a guy. Crotchet window is based. Everyone has the same face with a different hair and eye colors. MC is useless but he is trying his best huehue.
The show would be better if the MC had to dress as a girl and sell himself as prostitute to pay debts, it would probably pay better than spamming dungeons as well. 
The dungeon is also weird as fuck, what kind of dungeon requires to solve accounting problems? New character is the big anime tiddie 12 year old. On that note, everyone is overdeveloped and stacked with thicc thighs.
Oppai lolis seem to be the future based on recent shows.
  
I'll rate this a solid 7 dungeons out of 10.
