The suspense is building up from the get go. Kagome yelling "Inuyasha" at the top of her lungs will never stop right? Even during a fight Miroku is a perv and wants to violate Sango, some things really never do get old.
What a coincidence, who would have guessed that Inuyasha, Sesshomaru and Kikyo end up at the same place yet again.
If some remember, in the anime there was Hoshiyomi with his four Ninja's which represented Suzaku, Byakko, Seiryuu and Genbu, this time around the enemies are the four War Gods which represent them.

   
The third movie was the best out of them all, this one feels kinda like a normal episode but it is still a great watch. 7/10
