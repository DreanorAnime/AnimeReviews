## Synopsis
>After leaving Greed Island, Gon and Killua meet up with Kite. They're all hired to investigate a strange insect leg that washed up on a beach. Genetic testing determines that the leg belongs to an abnormally large Chimera Ant Queen, which just happens to wash up on the shore of an island called the NGL (Neo-Green Life). The Chimera Ants proceed to wipe most of the population out and spawn hundreds of offspring for next generation before Gon, Killua, and Kite arrive to stop her.

## Review
The ants are pretty poggers.

I like the crazy and strong catgirl, seems overpowered but fun. Holy crap does the zombie lady looks cute when she actually dresses up. This is also the arc where lots of characters die.

The Chimera Ant King is basically Cell from Dragon Ball, just smarter. They are overall pretty Dragon Ball like with their powers and flying shit. Gon looks fucking gay when he aged up in his kid outfit and got the same babyface.

RIP Netero, Neferpitou, Pokkle, Kite, Peggy. Pretty sad that catgirl died, at least Palm looks better now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
   
Best arc yet 9/10
