## Synopsis
>The four main characters reunite for the world's largest auction in a sprawling metropolis named Yorknew City. Gon, Killua, and Leorio try different methods to make enough money to buy Greed Island, a JoyStation Console video game which could help Gon find his father. Meanwhile, Kurapika works as a bodyguard for Neon Nostrade, a flesh collector and daughter to the head of a Mafia family, in order for him to get closer to his clan's Scarlet Eyes which are set to be auctioned in the same city. The Phantom Troupe, a group of thieves, who had slaughtered Kurapika's clan, are also gathering at Yorknew City.

## Review
Finally we get to see more of the Phantom Troupe.

They all seem pretty overpowered, but due to some plot armor Kurapika has the strongest chains in the world. The auction got cancelled a couple of times, most new introduced characters died and the Phantom Troupe is weakend at least for now.

Judging by whats going on, the boss will most likely come back after a couple of arcs and tries to take his revenge on Kurapika. Over the course of the entire arc, Leorio seemed the most useless character, he is weaker than everyone else and is just no good. I hope he will get fleshed out in later arcs, because right now he is just a leech.
   
Very good arc, keeps things interesting 9/10
