>
>Ranma ½ follows the hilarious adventures of Ranma and Akane as they encounter various opponents, meet new love interests, and find different ways to make each other angry, all while their engagement hangs over their head.

## Review
Has some funny jokes and is a nice spin on gender bender, probably the only one that got popular.

Back in the good old days when you could watch this on TV with boobs left and right, made kids horny everywhere. The old fart is fucking annoying and the most retarded character. Apart from that all the girls are cute in some way.

Ryoga is the definition of a beta and a cuck. Staying as a little pig and getting close to Akane while hiding the fact that he actually is a hooman.
   
Still good enough though 8/10
