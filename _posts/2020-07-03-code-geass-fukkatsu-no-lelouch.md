Oh man, it has already been 5 years since I finished watching the anime, time really does fly by.

I still fucking hate Suzaku and it didn't change after watching this movie. C.C. remains the best girl and is taking care of the now mentally retarded Lelouch.
Lelouch made a really nice comback at the prison, things are about to get hyped! The reactions of everyone seeing Lelouch are really good and fitting. Going back in time is overpowered as a geass, but that didn't really help her.
Nice ending with C.C and L.L going on a journey.

This movie is really good, I give it a 9/10
