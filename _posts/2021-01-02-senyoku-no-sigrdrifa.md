## Synopsis
>The Pillars suddenly appeared above Earth, threatening all life. A god who called himself Odin came to the aid of humanity as it was driven to near complete defeat. To counter the Pillars, Odin declared a counterattack by bequeathing humanity with the battle maidens Walküres and the "herocraft" as their wings.
>
>Several years later, the battle between humanity and Pillars rages on, with men supporting the Walküres as they soar through the treacherous skies to save the world.
>
>Japan is no exception. Three Walküres confront the giant Pillar looming over sacred Mt. Fuji. Each Walküre is skilled, but each also has issues. And now, an ace pilot has arrived from Europe.
>
>"Now is the time to fight back, humanity. The day of reckoning has arrived. The time of Ragnarok draws nears."

## Review
What the fuck is this? Planes with magic wings and shit. Throw in some random german words for your planes and norse gods and you get this pile of anime.

Military uses jet fighters and the girls use pointless outdated planes for no reason whatsoever. Cute girls do cute things is fine but fucking planes fighting aliens is so god damn boring that this is almost a hard pass and I have to really force myself to watch this pile of shit.

The few cute interactions make up for it but just barely. It really is just trash.
   
I want to go back in time and stop myself from watching it 2/10
