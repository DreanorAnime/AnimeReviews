## Synopsis
>Our heroes to push forward to save Alice. The final arc of Sword Art Online: Alicization is coming soon!

## Review
Welcome back to Rape Art Online!

Kirito is still a potato sack and all the girls are after his dick. 9 minutes speedrun to the first rape scene where Leafa gets tentacle raped. Just imagine how many doujins this must have spawned with Leafa x Pig.

Leafa is just a horny elf that wanted to get raped and when she came, she just obliterated her enemy. Who the fuck wrote this plot? If I want to watch some tentacle rape I go to nhentai. Classic SAO was better where you would actually die, this is filled with NPCs no one gives a fuck about and it takes away the suspense.
Everyone who survived SAO got dragged into this mess to help protect potato Kirito. Asuna is also retarded jumping into battle with heels. Top kek they even got Korea and Chinks involved, seems like bullshit marketing to me.

Sinon also found her rapist again, what a wholesome reunion! She is useless and gets wet once she gets touched. Nowadays SAO is just a gloryfied rape and NTR VRMMORPG for the mainstream population.
I think Alicization is pretty bad Animation wise, it is worse than the rest of the series and the battles look sometimes weird. Also when there are lots of effects getting spammed, the screen gets slightly blackened which is pretty annoying. 

All the players are dying or losing limbs, I guess this is one of the darkest and rapiest iterations of SAO. Leafa is fucking cheating, losing limbs and getting her eye pierced just to recover it after one second.
It took a long time till the potato sack woke up. The moment he came back he obliterated everyone in a single attack like the overpowered faggot he is. Eugeo made Kirito gay as fuck. Asuna is a bad waifu not even kissing her husbando, damn bitch is so useless no wonder Kirito turned gay.

Why is there always so much bullshit happening last minute to fuck everything up? Kirito scored a sex robot for his harem. Looks like the next SAO is going to space, oh boi what else can they milk?
  
One thing that SAO has going for it is good sound design and openings. Don't question the logic of SAO because there is none. 8/10
