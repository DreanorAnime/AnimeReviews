## Review
Animation gets worse and worse, the only saving point of this is the story and all the music provided by Sawano Hiroyuki. The opening is also pretty good.

The beginning was pretty slow but it got better, the entire angels vs demon storyline is overused. Good ending for the series after all with most of them having children.
   
Not so bad after all 8/10
