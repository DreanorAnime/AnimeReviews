## Synopsis
>After passing the Hunter Exam, Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio go off on a new adventure to spring Killua from his parents' mansion in Kukuroo Mountain. After the three reunite with Killua, Leorio leaves for medical school so he can become a professional doctor, and Kurapika leaves to find work as a bounty hunter. Gon and Killua decide to go together to Heavens Arena so they can gain combat experience by training.

## Review
The Hunters are on their way to Killua, the story picks right off where the last arc ended. Imagine owning and living on a mountain.

His entire family is quite quirky, the mom looks like a robot, his brother is a fat whiny boy, the sister looks alright and his father seems to plot something. The entire staff is overpowered and they got big ass heavy doors.

Episode 26 is pretty worthless, that recap was way too soon tbh.
   
Nice to see Killua's family and how he acts towards everyone 7/10
