## Synopsis
>Hundreds of years ago, the Chinese Zodiac spirits and their god swore to stay together eternally. United by this promise, the possessed members of the Souma family shall always return to each other under any circumstances. Yet, when these bonds shackle them from freedom, it becomes an undesirable burdenâ€”a curse. As head of the clan, Akito is convinced that he shares a special connection with the other Soumas. While he desperately clings to this fantasy, the rest of the family remains isolated and suppressed by the fear of punishment.
>
>Tooru Honda, who has grown attached to the Soumas, is determined to break the chains that bind them. Her companionship with the family and her friends encourages her to move forward with lifting the curse. However, due to confounding revelations, she struggles to find the tenacity to continue her endeavors. With time slowly withering away, Tooru contends with an uncertain future in hopes of reaching the tranquility that may lie beyond all this commotion.

## Review
Perfect ending with lots of happy moments. The reboot really did something good for the series as a whole. Only took 20 years to get a ending but it was worth the wait.

Also wtf ranked 4 on mal holy top kek. Best reboot to ever happen to all of anime.
   
Everyone wins the romance roulette 8/10
