## Synopsis
>"Dear diary... I got reincarnated as a slime."
>
>Even in another world, lives aren't always on the line. There's plenty of work to be done, from feeding the community and forging the items the community needs; as well as plenty of play ...and hijinks throughout! Join Rimuru and friends as they kick back and enjoy their daily lives.

## Review
Slime of Life / Slice of Slime?

Relaxing stories about the everyday life of the town. It was nice to pass the time, but I really want to see the main plot again. It cut off at a interesting point.
   
YEP. 7/10
