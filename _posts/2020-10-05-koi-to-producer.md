## Synopsis
>A girl inherits a company that is almost bankrupt from her late father. Lacking the funds, she must now become the producer herself in order to save the company from collapse.
>During her work, she meets four boys—financial expert Zen, the idol Kira, police officer Haku, and leading neuroscientist Simon—and is suddenly involved with the conspiracies and mysteries over the existence of special powers known as "Evol."

## Review
The subs are fucking garbage, it is confusing that all the characters have different names than what they are called. Like Lucien is Simon what the hell were they thinking? Fucking trash subbers and if this is from a game I care even less.

The boi harem has a superhuman genepool and talents while the Queen is just a breeding machine waiting to breed and useless otherwise. The entire thing is mediocre and the plot gets confusing and retarded later on.
   
Meh 5/10
