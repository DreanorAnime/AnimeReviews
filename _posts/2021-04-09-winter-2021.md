My Review of everything I watched this season. Spoilers ahead!

## Best OP/ED ##
Not every season has good and enjoyable music, this has quite a few. These are my top OP/EDs of this season. I even found a few new bands to listen to:

**Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation OP - [Tabibito no Uta - Yuiko Oohara]**  
This gives me strong Spice and Wolf vibes, so it is meaningful to me and sounds great. Feels very nostalgic.

**Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation ED - [Only - Yuiko Oohara]**  
Impressive, I guess I like Yuiko's songs overall, this one is also really good.

**Dr. Stone: Stone Wars OP - [Rakuen - Fujifabric]**  
Good and upbeat, fitting for the anime and just good to listen to.

**Dr. Stone: Stone Wars OP - [Koe? - Hatena]**  
Good OP and good ED, they really hit the songs this season.

**Beastars 2nd Season 2 OP - [Kaibutsu - YOASOBI]**  
Fitting title and song for the anime.

**Yakusoku no Neverland 2nd Season OP - [Identity - Kiro Akiyama]**  
Good song, but not that fitting for the anime, should've been something darker.

**Hortensia Saga OP - [Leader - MY FIRST STORY]**  
This actually surprised me to see it as a opening, been listening to it a few times before and it is nice.

**Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken 2nd Season ED - [STORYSEEKER - STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION]**  
SDF has lots of good songs and this one is also pretty damn nice.

**Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season OP - [My War - Shinsei Kamattechan]**  
Fitting, it is about War and shadows what is about to come.

**Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season ED - [Shock - Yuko Ando]**  
Sounds pretty good and has a underlying sad tone to it.

**Jujutsu Kaisen ED - [LOST IN PARADISE - AKLO]**  
Listen to it before as well and it sounds just good.

**Jujutsu Kaisen OP2 - [VIVID VICE - Who-ya Extended]**  
I am seriously impressed by this season, there are good songs everywhere.

**SK8 OP - [Paradise - Rude-α]**  
Sounds cool and has somewhat skating vibes.

## Best of the entire season ##  
Ten Sura was really great! The moment he turned into a Demon Lord and the way that lead up to it were really amazing, can't wait for the 2nd part! [Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken 2nd Season](https://dreanoranime.github.io/AnimeReviews/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken-2nd-season/)
