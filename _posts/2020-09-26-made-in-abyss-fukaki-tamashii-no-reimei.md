## Synopsis
>Made in Abyss Movie 3: Fukaki Tamashii no Reimei continues the epic adventure of Riko and Reg who are joined by their new friend Nanachi. Together, they descend into the Abyss' treacherous fifth layer, the Sea of Corpses, and encounter the mysterious Bondrewd, a legendary White Whistle whose shadow looms over Nanachi's troubled past. Bondrewd is ingratiatingly hospitable, but the brave adventurers know things are not always as they seem in the enigmatic Abyss...

## Review
Nanachi is the best and all the noises she makes are adorable.

Bonedaddy finally gets the blessing after all these years of parenting that little broken piece of shit. His experiment was a success and he can get another loli to love him, box her ass and rope jump a few time to get the blessing again.

The loli turned into Riko's white whistle and got her dream of going onto a journey, just in a twisted way. Reg is a die hard furry and can't live without Nanachi's fur, he even got a boner just touching her and he probably coomed as well.
   
Really good and I can't wait till the next Season to start 9/10
