## Synopsis
>BEM ~BECOME HUMAN~ takes place 2 years after the events of the TV series and follows Sonia as she continues to try to track down the "humanoid monsters". Her search takes her to a drug company called Draco Chemical, where she meets a man named Belm Eyesburg who looks exactly like Bem. Meanwhile, Belo continues fighting on his own in an effort to let Bela live as an ordinary human girl. After encountering Sonia, Belum begins having nightmares that make him question his own identity, and his peaceful, ordinary life with his wife and family begins to collapse...

## Review
All employees are on drugs 24/7 and that dragon screams evil corporation all over.

Fucking ken doll body is horrendous and disturbing. Pretty boring in the end and way too long for little story to happen.
   
Ehh, not really worth the watch 5/10
