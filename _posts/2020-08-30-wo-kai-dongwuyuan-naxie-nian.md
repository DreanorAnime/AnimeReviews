## Synopsis
>Duan Jiaze inherited a private zoo and was forced to sign a contract after his graduation. And from that day onwards the first ever age classified Luya zoo appeared, those aged under 21 are prohibited to enter.

## Review
Looks very intersting, a boy inherited a zoo and all the animals are humans that can transform into mystical beings. The fox loli is the best girl.

It is a shame that there are not a lot of other mystical animals in the zoo, it would make it better in my opinion. The KetchupSubs are also not the best but they convey what the characters say and are not as annoying and cringy as fucking Mizu.
   
Cute and short story about the special zoo. 6/10
