## Synopsis
>Nasa Yuzaki is determined to leave his name in the history books. Ranking first in the national mock exam and aiming for a distinguished high school, he is certain that he has his whole life mapped out. However, fate is a fickle mistress. On his way home one snowy evening, Nasa's eyes fall upon a peerless beauty across the street. Bewitched, Nasa tries to approach her—only to get blindsided by an oncoming truck.
>
>Thankfully, his life is spared due to the girl's swift action. Bleeding by the side of an ambulance, he watches as the girl walks away under the moonlight—reminiscent of Princess Kaguya leaving for the moon. Refusing to let this chance meeting end, he forces his crippled body to chase after her and asks her out. Surprised by his foolhardiness and pure resolve, the girl accepts his confession under a single condition: they can only be together if he marries her!

## Review
I don't know what is more unrealistic, getting married this quickly or that all the stores are open in the night.

Seems pretty cute and them holding hands is adorable. Cute things everywhere. With all the hints throughout I'd say she is over 1400 years old but keeps the appearance of a 16 year old girl. Makes sense in a lot of conversations.

Dare I say anime of the season? I do! This will either drive young people to marry or kill themself out of depressing in never finding a waifu that is as caring and cute as this.

Nice to see Hayate show up at the festival as well, seems interesting that the author has boths of his creations in one world.
   
Kawaii UwU 10/10
