Finally we entered the era of the glorious 16:9 format. I am getting tired of people going on the verge of death, just to come back again, why can't they just off people without all the bullshit like how Kagura died even though it was very late into the entire series.
Sesshomaru got even stronger with his almost cheat like weapon. It is really nice to see Sesshomaru's mother. Things are getting more interesting and finish up what was left in the main series.
   
 8/10
