## Synopsis
>Thwarted again by Naraku, Inuyasha, Kagome Higurashi, and their friends must continue their hunt for the few remaining Shikon Jewel shards, lest they fully form into a corrupted jewel at the hands of Naraku. But Naraku has plans of his own to acquire them, and will destroy anyone and anything standing in his way—even his own underlings.
>
>The persistent, unyielding danger posed by Naraku forces Sango and Miroku to decide what is most important to them—each other or their duty in battle. Meanwhile, Inuyasha must decide whether his heart lies with Kikyou or Kagome, before fate decides for him. Amid the race to find the shards, Inuyasha and his brother Sesshoumaru must also resolve their feud and cooperate for their final confrontation with Naraku, as it is a battle they must win in order to put a stop to his evil and cruelty once and for all.

## Review
Finally we entered the era of the glorious 16:9 format. 

I am getting tired of people going on the verge of death, just to come back again, why can't they just off people without all the bullshit like how Kagura died even though it was very late into the entire series.

This time around Sesshomaru gets incredibly strong and has a almost cheat like weapon that he can call his own. Later we even get to see Sesshomaru's mother while he overcomes a trial for his new weapon. 

To be honest, the main series had too many fillers and dragged everything out, here we get a conclusion to the long fight against Naraku and a satisfying ending. Also not to forget, after almost 200 episodes of butt touching, Sango gave in and had children with Miroku
   
Why even watch the original series if you get everything compact in 26 episodes? 8/10
