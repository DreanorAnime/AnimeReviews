## Review
Some gay shit ehh?

What is the point? Seems like a waste of time just to have some dudes fuck each other, no satisfying plot or anything. Of couse all the mentally retarded traps and gays will flock to it, but it is nothing special.

Cats where the best part of the anime kek.
   
Gay fucks 3/10
