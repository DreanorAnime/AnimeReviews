Rin, who is now stranded for a few days, is invited by Nadeshiko Kagamihara to stay at her grandmother's house.
>
>What is supposed to be a two-day trip becomes an extended period of sightseeing and new experiences for Rin, and she encounters some new and old faces along the way. Yuru Camp△ Season 2 continues the story of Rin, Nadeshiko, and their friends as they further explore the joys of camping.
