## Synopsis
>Second half of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 2nd Season.

## Review
Not enough Rem.

Holy shit Geuse was actually a good guy before he went into his desu desu self. So much backstory in this part it is beyond amazing. It focuses mostly on Emilia, as much as expected since she is the authors favorite. I'd rather see more Ram and Rem. Ram actually went and confessed to Roswaal.

Emilia is so adorable at the end, she still thinks kissing makes babies.
   
Rem is still a potato 9/10
