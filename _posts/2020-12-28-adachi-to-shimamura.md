## Synopsis
>The second floor of the gym―this was where we always met. It was class time, but of course, there weren't any classes going on in a place like this.
>
>This was where Shimamura and I became friends. We hung out here―talking about TV shows and cooking, playing some ping pong... This is where we fostered our friendship.
>
>Keeping my head propped against the wall, I let out a small sigh.
>
>What was this feeling? Yesterday, I'd dreamt of me and Shimamura kissing.
>
>Not that I'm like that. I'm sure Shimamura isn't either. It's not even something worth repeating myself about, but really, it's not like that.
>
>It's just that when she hears the word "friend," I want her to think of me first. That's all.
## Review
Smells like yuribait. Yep, autism yuri. Boomerang dildo present is suspicious. That whole alien subplot is also retarded as fuck and annoying.

The MC is a romantic coward and an oblivious love interest and teases romance without any progress. Hell the side characters have more depth and offer more entertainment. Both main characters are fake deep and never actually act or expand on their self reflections. They even have the balls to introduce a romantic rival to Adachi in ep7 and there isn't even any fucking romance yet. 

How dare this shit show even have the tag of romance when literally the only real romance so far is friendship hand holding. Adachi is a blank basic bitch who gets jealous over children wanting attention from Shimamura. Shimamura is a mess of a character, confused about every relationship she has and is distant from her own friends.
   
Fucking yuribait without romance 4/10
