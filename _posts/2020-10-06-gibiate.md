>
>Together, they fight countless Gibia monsters, outlaws, and other fierce foes on their journey to save mankind.

## Review
Corona-chan the anime fastforward to 2030.

The animation is shit and this is the worst CGI I have ever seen in my entire life. The whole point is to show off the fights against the Gibia but it looks hideous.

Kathleen carries the entire anime just because she is eyecandy. There are so many stories with samurai and time travel that it is just annoying at this point.
   
Shit CGI and pointless story 2/10
