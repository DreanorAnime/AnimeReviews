## Synopsis
>Fifteen-year-old Yuna prefers staying home and obsessively playing her favorite VRMMO to doing anything else, including going to school. When a strange new update gives her a one-of-a-kind bear outfit that comes with overpowered abilities, Yuna is torn: the outfit is unbearably cute, but too embarrassing to wear in-game. But then she suddenly finds herself transported into the world of the game, facing down monsters and magic for real, and the bear suit becomes the best weapon she has!

## Review
One of my all time favorite manga finally got a anime adaption. Let's see if it holds up to the original.

Watch Order should be 2 > 3 > 1 > 4... everything else is fine. They really failed with that one. The opening is also not that good. 

Just as cite as I imagined it would be. Good work on the animation and staying true to the manga. Anime Yuna is good at grooming like her manga counterpart.
   
Good adaption 10/10
