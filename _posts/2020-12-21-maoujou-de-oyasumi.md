## Synopsis
>Sshhh! Princess Syalis is trying to get a good night's sleep. Some shut-eye. Forty winks. Catch some Z's. Long ago in olden times when people and demons lived together in—well, disharmony, really—a demon king kidnaps a human princess and imprisons her in his castle. Bereft, the princess's subjects beat their chests in anguish...until a hero arises to spearhead Project Rescue Our Princess! While waiting for her knight in shining armor, what's an imprisoned princess to do...? Teddy-bear guards with bat wings are all very well, but her dungeon cell is bo-o-o-ring! So, she decides to wile away the long hours by sleeping. Now if only she could get comfortable...and didn't suffer from insomnia...

## Review
Opening seems fun. Lots of adorable demons and a sleepyhead princess as well.

Every episode shows multiple different forms of going to sleep or creating beds. Very relaxing to watch and requires no brain to get into.
   
Suya~ 7/10
