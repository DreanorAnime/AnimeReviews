## Synopsis
>With the Royal Knights having been selected, they begin their attack on the base of the Eye of the Midnight Sun. During the battle, things do not go as planned when many of the Knights turn against each other when the Elf Tribe is reincarnated into them.

## Review
This Review is about the Reincarnation Arc that ran from episode 85 to 120.

Everytime I come back to watch the latest episodes I get reminded of how amazing the OP is, there isn't a single bad one so far. The ghost of the hideout is actually a member of the Black Bulls! Who would've known.

Now the cat is out of the bag, the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun is William after all. Unexpected and it happened way too fast, but F to the Wizard King. Nani?! So much is happening, lots of people and even Yuno turned into an Elf!

Starting with Episode 95 there is a new OP which is pretty comfy. They swap OP's really fast, at least in this Arc... Episode 103 changes it up yet again with a good one. The battle against the devil is pretty good and it ends in a wholesome ending and conclusion with the elves. Somehow the Wizard King also survived and is now young.
   
Lots of hype and lots of new OP's 9/10
