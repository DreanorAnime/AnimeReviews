## Synopsis
>A youth romantic drama with themes of growing up, the story focuses on college student Tsuneo and dreamer Josee, who lives her life stuck in a cripple. Josee—named after the heroine in Françoise Sagan's Wonderful Clouds—spends most of her days reading and painting until by chance she encounters Tsuneo, and decides it's time to face the real world.

## Review
Sweet romance with angry cripple girl turning her slave into her boyfriend slave.

Heartwarming and good story, that one work girl is kind of a bitch. This is basically how to groom a cripple that lost her only related human being into your wife.
   
Cute 9/10
