GM-Team is a good group, they make subs that are readable and not a fucking mess like Mizu. The cat is pretty badass. Seems pretty weird that there are some characters that look straight ripped off Boku no Hero Academia.
The cat actually turns into a cat if he doesn't take his meds, it also doesn't look like Chen will find his brother any time soon. Plot is okayish.
  
This deserves 6 out of 10 cat paws.
