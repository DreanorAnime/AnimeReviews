## Synopsis
>Second season of Muhyo to Rouji no Mahouritsu Soudan Jimusho.

## Review
Not sure why but it feels boring and like a pain to watch.

This is yet another Funimation sub that is garbage. I can barely say anything about it, this is very mediocre. It is okay to watch and waste some time but there is nothing special about it.
  
Meh 5/10
