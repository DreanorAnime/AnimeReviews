First off, whoever thought that it is funny to put inn random thoughts and references as well as smileys in these subs should go fuck themself. 
Why can't we have good subs that are not cringy for chinese anime? On this note fuck Mizu subs as well.  

On to the anime, it starts out pretty generic like most other chinese anime. There is a fighting tournament going on for the cultivators, the MC is way too overpowered and blasts through everything.
He then goes on to get even more powerful with a special Spiritual Art. The story jumps all over the place and way too fast, which is worrying.  
  
I rate this one 6 fuck your subs out of 10
