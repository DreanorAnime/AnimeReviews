My Review of everything I watched this season. Spoilers ahead! I think this season wasn't too bad overall. There is obviously some trash like Tamayomi, but that is a given. This season was pretty horrible OP/ED wise, apart from Kami no Tou which was really good.

[Princess Connect! Re:Dive](https://kitsu.io/anime/princess-connect-redive) - 9/10  
Everything is super cute and it is fun to watch. Kokoro has an amazing surprised face, she is also a mommydaughterwife. MC is a empty shell, but we are all here for the cute girls anyway. Even the llama is cute and fluffy! Daijoubu my friend-kun number one is a nice addition. Loli Elf > Neko > Yabai

[Gleipnir](https://kitsu.io/anime/gleipnir) - 9/10  
Darling in the Fursuit. Pretty lewd overall with an interesting story. Simp power only works for the grills.

[Kakushigoto](https://kitsu.io/anime/kakushigoto-tv) - 9/10  
Really good start into this season, has adorable moments and funny interactions, kept me hooked into the story till the end, really satisfying ending. Pointless cousin shows up last minute and doesn't even has a name, also Rasuna stole all his assistants kek

[Honzuki no Gekokujou](https://kitsu.io/anime/honzuki-no-gekokujou-shisho-ni-naru-tame-ni-wa-shudan-wo-erandeiraremasen-2) - 8/10  
Myne Kampf can't possibly be this cute. Her family is mostly irrelevant in this arc it's a shame, it was wholesome. Myne is a smug priestess loli that collapses a lot.

[Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!](https://kitsu.io/anime/hachi-nan-tte-sore-wa-nai-desho) - 8/10  
Some people hate it, some like it, enjoyable Isekai with cute girls and overpowered MC, Pink is the best with fatty tuna&banana, drove his brother to madness so he can steal his waifu

![img](..\assets\spring2020\towerofgod.jpg)
[Kami no Tou: Tower of God](https://kitsu.io/anime/tower-of-god) - 8/10  
Best OP and ED of the season. /a/utism threads are pretty funny with all the webtoon incels. Fuck Rachel she is a dumb cunt.

![img](..\assets\spring2020\nami.jpg)
[Nami yo Kiitekure](https://kitsu.io/anime/nami-yo-kiitekure) - 7/10  
Woman rants about her life and ends up as a host on a radio show, she acts out like a batshit crazy bitch on show and fucks up the life of a lonely guy while also teasing her restaurant buddy without knowing it

![img](..\assets\spring2020\otome.jpg)
[Otome Game](https://kitsu.io/anime/otome-game-no-hametsu-flag-shika-nai-akuyaku-reijou-ni-tensei-shiteshimatta) - 7/10  
Weeb gets Isekaid into 8 year old loli. Magic school but no one is actually learning magic. Geodude has to endure horny freeloaders being around his wife all the time. Also how would 4 men and 3 woman have sex with one woman

![img](..\assets\spring2020\kaguya.jpg)
[Kaguya-sama: Love is War 2](https://kitsu.io/anime/kaguya-sama-wa-kokurasetai-tensai-tachi-no-renai-zunousen-2) - 7/10  
sugar daddy. Sister is best girl confirmed. Maid had a yuri threesome in the end. Miko is cute but turns into a slut infront of a camera (she is also a goblin).

![img](..\assets\spring2020\arte.jpg)
[Arte](https://kitsu.io/anime/arte) - 6/10  
Fuck Universal. Arte won't get motivated until she gets treated like shit. Now on sale, Artes bathwater. Tiny, grumpy, needy, hungry, hairy, moody Venetian loli. The venetian loli does not ask. The venetian loli DEMANDS. She single handedly carried the show.

![img](..\assets\spring2020\shiro.jpg)
[Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle](https://kitsu.io/anime/shironeko-project-zero-chronicle) - 6/10  
The best episode is picking vegetables and swapping clothes. Groza is best girl. Snail pace story. It is not bad or good, it's something inbetween.

![img](..\assets\spring2020\tsugu.jpg)
[Tsugu Tsugumomo](https://kitsu.io/anime/tsugu-tsugumomo) - 6/10  
meh they killed off Kiriha and now there is a 3 year boring ass training arc with pee flute coming up. Milf is pretty good. F sexy tiny loligod.

![img](..\assets\spring2020\tantei.jpg)
[Kitsutsuki Tanteidokoro](https://kitsu.io/anime/kitsutsuki-tanteidokoro) - 6/10  
Detective in 1909, has some interesting mysteries going on. Towards the end he looks like a zombie.

[Plunderer](https://kitsu.io/anime/plunderer) - 5/10  
Friendly reminder to always put dick in crazy. The world is ruled by numbers, but they somehow forgot after like 2 episodes and never force it upon someone again. Waiting 300 years to get the dick but slutty girl did it in less than a year, also wants babies. For no reason they pulled the villagers back but it makes no sense, the plot is going everywhere with many many holes. Doesn't really stand out apart from some fanservice.

[Listeners](https://kitsu.io/anime/listeners) - 5/10  
Buckle up for some cringy random english one liners, tl;dw Some kid named Echo and some albino girl /mu/ go out on a journey to find albino Jimi Hendrix. Along the way they meet Einst√ºrzende Neubauten as Team Rocket, My Bloody Valentine, Kurt Cobain (female), Roger Waters' daughter, Tommy from that album by The Who, and a bunch of other shit. It's more music references than an actual story. Also this is mecha for some reason.

[A3! Season Spring & Summer](https://kitsu.io/anime/a-three) - 4/10  
Pretty boring, Summer part was better than the Spring part, nothing really special.

![img](..\assets\spring2020\zashiki.jpg)
[Zashiki Warashi no Tatami-chan](https://kitsu.io/anime/zashiki-warashi-no-tatami-chan) - 4/10  
IT manwhore. Rape Nun is alpha chad. S for let me have sex with you. What is even the point of this? At least it was a little bit enjoyable but overall meh.

![img](..\assets\spring2020\tama.jpg)
[Tamayomi](https://kitsu.io/anime/tamayomi) - 3/10  
Bad animation, shit CGI, bland characters, basic plot for a sports anime. I will only miss the thighs and muscles service

![img](..\assets\spring2020\yesterday.jpg)
[Yesterday wo Utatte](https://kitsu.io/anime/yesterday-wo-utatte) - 3/10  
Imagine being so retarded that you use a safety pin as a piercing. Also who the fuck goes after the dead brothers girlfriend. Fuck this unholy dumpster fire into the pits of hell. I have to go back in time and stop myself from watching this.
