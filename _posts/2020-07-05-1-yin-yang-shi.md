Humans and Demons coexist, but the demons just want to have fun everyday. Surprisingly all characters look cute and well drawn for a short, it is disappointing that the episodes are just 5 minutes, it would be so much better if it was longer, but it is definitely worth watching.
This is basically cute demon girls do cute things. I'm impressed that they managed to get some good voice actors for this short, there is the VA of Dio and Lelouch which stand out.
  
Surprisingly fun to watch even if it is short. 8/10
