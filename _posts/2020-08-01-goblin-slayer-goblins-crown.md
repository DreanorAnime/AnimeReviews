Time for some more rape and goblin slaying!

Ehh, 25 minute recape of the entire first season is pretty pointless tbh, considering that it had no value to the rest of the movie. On to the real part now.
The violence has been turned down quite a lot compared to the anime. Hurr durr let's do a siege on the goblins while we're outnumbered, have no supplies and are in the middle of winter in the mountains, I bet this can't go wrong.
Well it does, her entire party dies and she gets gobo branded and most likely raped by the entire cave. They didn't even show how the red haired girl got raped and cut in pieces.
   
Pretty mediocre and it's missing most violent parts from the manga 7/10
