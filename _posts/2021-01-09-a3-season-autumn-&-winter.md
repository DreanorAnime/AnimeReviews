## Synopsis
>"Director! Please help us bloom!"

>In Tokyo, there is a place called Velude Way. It is a district notorious for its performers and theatrical groups. Izumi Tachibana, who was previously a stage actress, arrives with a letter that reads, "Full of debt! Zero customers! Only one actor!"

## Review
This is shit.

TL;DW everything stays the same nothing interesting happens. The characters are still all shit. If you really have nothing bettter to do and want to watch some braindead musical drama this might be for you otherwise pass.
   
Meh. 3/10
