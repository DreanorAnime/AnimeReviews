## Synopsis

Though they are sworn enemies, the knight is taken by her beauty and dignity, and the princess is moved by his strength and way of life. Will the fighting between them ever be allowed to end?

## Review
Kimisen aka Today I got released from prison and I took my friend and two big tiddy waifus to the frontlines.

It feels somewhat pointless and borderline boring to watch. Nothing really matters and is bland. It is almost as if I was watching a cheap knockoff of Romeo and Juliet. Would've been better if it was a romance and only about the two main characters falling in love, everything else is just meh.
   
Boring generic shit 5/10
