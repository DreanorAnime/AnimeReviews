## Synopsis
>The OVA will be focus on when Kujaku Nijou first entering group, which occurs one year before the main anime begins.

## Review
The opening is pretty good and that's it.

Seems pretty meh for a prequel, getting framed by someone in the force with a boring plot overall. I don't see much of a point in this ova.
   
Just plain boring 4/10
