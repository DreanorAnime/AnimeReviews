## Synopsis
>Two young people living in the Wahrheit Empire are planning to relocate to the capital city: the shy Inumael who works as a transporter and left his beloved sister behind at his parents' home, and Leocadio, a naive new soldier of the Empire who spends his days in the imperial city thinking of his future as a soldier.
>
>In the Empire, countless human beings were once extinguished from the world. The return of the "light," the disaster that summoned a ferocious monster into the world, is predicted, and the remaining humans' spirits are devastated. Meanwhile, the fate of Inumael, Leocadio, and the history of the Empire will change drastically as a result of one weapon smuggling incident.

## Review
Fuck universal.

One of, if not the worst opening I have ever seen. Screems like a giant self pat on the back for Universal niggers. Nothing got resolved in the end, there are shit tons of loose ends.

If there is not a second season, then what was the point? It got really interesting towards the end but now it will be pretty much dead for the next few years.
   
Intersting this just happened in the last episodes 6/10
