## Synopsis
>Lain Iwakura, an awkward and introverted fourteen-year-old, is one of the many girls from her school to receive a disturbing email from her classmate Chisa Yomodaâ€”the very same Chisa who recently committed suicide. Lain has neither the desire nor the experience to handle even basic technology; yet, when the technophobe opens the email, it leads her straight into the Wired, a virtual world of communication networks similar to what we know as the internet. Lain's life is turned upside down as she begins to encounter cryptic mysteries one after another. Strange men called the Men in Black begin to appear wherever she goes, asking her questions and somehow knowing more about her than even she herself knows. With the boundaries between reality and cyberspace rapidly blurring, Lain is plunged into more surreal and bizarre events where identity, consciousness, and perception are concepts that take on new meanings.
>
>Written by Chiaki J. Konaka, whose other works include Texhnolyze, Serial Experiments Lain is a psychological avant-garde mystery series that follows Lain as she makes crucial choices that will affect both the real world and the Wired. In closing one world and opening another, only Lain will realize the significance of their presence.

## Review
Stay away from the fanbase, they are all cucks pretending that this is a masterpiece and nothing can compare to it.

A friend of mine recommended this to me, I came for the fucked up story but was disappointed in the end. Nothing is ever explained and all the characters are shallow as fuck. Don't pretend this is a masterpiece or something else that it isn't. Lain throws in many concepts that just don't make any sense or that are enjoyable to watch.

If you need to explain shit outside of the anime for it to make sense, it has failed in my books here is a website that explains some things about Lain http://www.cjas.org/~leng/lain.htm if you want to invest more time into this mess.
   
Waste of time and boring. 2/10
