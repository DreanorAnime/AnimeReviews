## Synopsis
>Second season of World Trigger.

## Review
Opening song is trash.

The animation looks better than in the first season, but that is a given after 7 years. This little cunt is so annoying, she has massive powers but is too retarded and scared to hurt people and still tries to save somne. Just fucking kill them they don't die for real anyway.
   
Somewhat decent 6/10
