The art style is very different compared to the anime, but it is a nice change to see, overall the animations felt better and higher quality than the anime.
I feel that the movie didn't make much sense, everything was dragged way too long and the last big fight was over way too fast. Kagome looks good dressed as a miko, she got randomly possesed and hurt Inuyasha. Afterwards Kikyo shows up out of nowhere, goes crazy bat shit bitch mode and makes Kagome go back to her time.
The death of the villain also felt a bit weird, here take my backlash and this arrow, now you are dead.
  
This could have been better but overall was okay. 7/10
