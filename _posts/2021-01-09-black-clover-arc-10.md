## Synopsis
>This arc revolves around the trial of Asta and Secre Swallowtail, the Black Bull squad's mission to investigate devils and Curse Magic, and the Magic Knights training to combat the Spade Kingdom.

## Review
This arc is broken down into smaller parts from episode 121 to 157. Julius is still alive but now back as a kid. The openings are all really good like always.

**Trial of the Devils**  
Asta and Secre got put on trial to take all the blame of the devils work. The stuck up jury gets yeeted and the black bulls get to carry on. 

Damnatio is another retarded character that is just beyond stupid and seeks to put blame on the wrong people. Charlotte gets to have a date with Yami and eases up on her whole lesbian crew.

**The Heart Kingdom**  
The Kingdom looks pretty nice and has lots of nature. This Kingdoms Queen is a total nerd and overly clumsy. Imagine tripping over after two steps and breaking hundreds of glasses every day.

Even though she is clumsy, she is really cute. This is also the first time we learn about stages which determine how good of a mage you are. 

If the devil is not dead after one year the queen will die, I'd imagine they won't kill her off and some bullshit happens if it should take longer than a year.

**Magic Knight Squad Captain Meeting**  
The useless king is back to make a speech no one is intersted in and of course it gets bombed. I really do hope that he will get killed at some point for being a useless king.

All the Squads are out on training and at some point Secre gets kidnapped by the by the anti devil faction which actually is pro devil. Some parts are painfully boring to watch and their motivation is also shit.

After killing people, throwing cities into chaos and doing other crimes they just get banished from the kingdom. Wtf are they even thinking? How about killing them insead of letting them go. This can go three ways now, they meet the devil and die, they meet the devil and join them or they get forgotten and will never be mentioned again.

**Arcane Stage Mages**
Some more training is going on and the squads fight each other for the public entertainment. There are some recaps in the later episodes to drag it out, but having fillers is pretty normal for long running series. The next arc will finally have some big ass battles against the devil.
  
Good arc like always 9/10
