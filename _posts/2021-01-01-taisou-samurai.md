## Synopsis
>Year 2002. Japan's gymnastics world was once strong. Former Japanese representative Shoutarou Aragaki (29), who devoted his time to gymnastics, was unable to perform as expected. Even so, after training on a daily basis, his coach Amakusa recommends Shoutarou to retire. However, the fate of the Aragaki family will change significantly due to a certain "encounter."

## Review
Well, this is something different.

Sports anime aren't my thing but this one was quite enjoyable. Not much else to say.
   
Gozaru 6/10
