## Synopsis
>Netero, the Hunter chairman has passed away after his confrontation with the Chimera Ant King, Meruem. A new Hunter chairman is needed, so the Zodiacs are gathered to establish a new election for their new Hunter chairman. Ging Freecss, one of the Zodiac members is leading the establishment. Leorio returns and quickly rises to prominence as a top candidate in the election. These events act as a backdrop to the efforts of Killua and his servants, who wish to revive a hospitalized Gon using the Nen ability of Alluka Zoldyck. Illumi, aided by Hisoka, attempts to stop Killua due to the potential dangers attached to using Alluka's powers.

## Review
Leorio and Kurapika somehow are relevant again. Who the fuck cares about dead weight characters.

This is a satisfying ending for the anime. Loose ends got resolved, Alluka was a nice addition but her existence kinda makes all the hardship pointless if you can just wish for whatever the fuck you want.
   
Nice way to end things. 8/10
