## Synopsis
>The story begins when Ao opens a package that arrives at her doorstep. Inside the package is Gourai, a Frame Arms Girl: a small robot capable of independent movement. Gourai is a newly-developed prototype: a Frame Arms Girl equipped with an "Artificial Self," an advanced AI that gives her a personality. Ao is the only one that has activated her. Gourai begins to gather both battle data and emotions, starting a day-to-day life with Ao, who knows nothing about Frame Arms Girls.

## Review
This is bascially a advertisement for a model kit of the FAGs. But it doesn't really matter to me, since we get to see a cute girl (Ao) that does cute things with the FAGs. 

Society already got rid of devlivery drivers and have drones do the deliveries. Ao is a interesting person that fights with her FAGs to earn money to be lazy and chill with her new found waifu harem. 

The battles do seem like straight out of a gacha game with their starting voicelines and whats going on. Having their cable plugged in to recharge is basically anal, most FAGs have visible panties at all times, they're all adorable little robot girls who you want to protect.

The OP is really upbeat and fits to the series. All FAGs are indeed fags as they can be seen having yuri scenes left and right.
   
Cute slice of life show with cute tiny robot girls. 6/10
