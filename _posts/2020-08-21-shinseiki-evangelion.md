## Synopsis
>In the year 2015, the world stands on the brink of destruction. Humanity's last hope lies in the hands of Nerv, a special agency under the United Nations, and their Evangelions, giant machines capable of defeating the Angels who herald Earth's ruin. Gendou Ikari, head of the organization, seeks compatible pilots who can synchronize with the Evangelions and realize their true potential. Aiding in this defensive endeavor are talented personnel Misato Katsuragi, Head of Tactical Operations, and Ritsuko Akagi, Chief Scientist.
>
>Face to face with his father for the first time in years, 14-year-old Shinji Ikari's average life is irreversibly changed when he is whisked away into the depths of Nerv, and into a harrowing new destinyâ€”he must become the pilot of Evangelion Unit-01 with the fate of mankind on his shoulders.
>Written by Hideaki Anno, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a heroic tale of a young boy who will become a legend. But as this psychological drama unfolds, ancient secrets beneath the big picture begin to bubble to the surface...

## Review
I don't understand everyones obsession for this series. It builds up an intruiging ongoing plot that completely implodes on itselfs in nonsensical up its ass religious shit. In the end it is just rose tinted glasses of nostalgia for some people.

Shinji is a 14 year old boy reaching puberty and one of the most pathetic main characters I have ever seen. He got scared because of a penguin in the bath and he obviously wants to fuck everything that can move.

Watching him interact with other characteres is painfully to watch and cringe. He has a mental breakdown every single time he is in fights, but then again it is just shit tier mecha fights with aliens vs robots piloted by underaged kids and the robots bleed for some reason to make it look more edgy.

He saw Rei (best girl) naked, stared at her getting dressed and didn't really react to it, guess he is a faggot after all. Also fuck Asuka she is a smartass and a bitch. Haha fat Asuka is a good Asuka. Hmm, so they have brains inside of supercomputers and they are based on personalities, this is utterly ridiculous.

Well, the Eva's actually get somewhat close to sentient beings and eat the angels pog. Asuka gets more annoying the longer she talks. Eva's are pretty fucked up. Shinji got scared of woman and now is a gay ass nigger. Towards the end it is like watching mecha with Beethoven music.
  
Fuck Shinji, the last 2 episode are also fucking garbage, but the rest is okayish 5/10
