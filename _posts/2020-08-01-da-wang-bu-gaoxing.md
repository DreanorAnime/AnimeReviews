The new King, in this case Queen, of the Underworld is a little girl scared of ghosts. She struggles to overcome her fear as she faces many situations with ghostly encounters.
Most of the characters are based on Chinese mythology, this is nothing groundbreaking and it tends to be very fast paced. Could be worse, but for the short episodes it is good enough.
   
6 Spoopy Ghosts out of 10 scared Yama's.
