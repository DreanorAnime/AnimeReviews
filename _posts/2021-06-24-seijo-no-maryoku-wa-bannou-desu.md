## Synopsis
>Since ancient times, the citizens of Salutania have lived within a shroud of miasma, a force that brings forth monsters creating havoc around the world. When the kingdom's Order of Knights becomes incapable of containing the monsters, the Grand Magus summons a holy maiden—the legendary "Saint"—to obliterate the horrid creatures and restore peace.
>
>One evening, as Sei Takanashi returns home from a long day at work, a magical force pulls her into a foreign world. Upon her arrival to the kingdom of Salutania, she overhears that the Grand Magus inadvertently summoned two Saints—Sei and a brown-haired girl. Needing only one holy maiden, the prince declares the other girl as the Saint, leaving Sei to her own devices.
>
>Sei sets her sight on the Medicinal Flora Research Institute, an establishment known for its studies regarding herbs and potions. While indulging in her latest passion, Sei has a fateful encounter with the commander of the Third Order of Knights. But little does she know, her aptitude as a Saint will continue to exert its influence over her new life.

## Review
Pretty cute and wholesome after a while.

It starts out with a retarded good for nothing prince and a handsome guard. Power of love theme is kinda weird for a saint but whatever.
   
Cute 8/10
