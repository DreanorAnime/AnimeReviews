## Synopsis
>Half-demon twins Towa and Setsuna were always together, living happily in Feudal Japan. But their joyous days come to an end when a forest fire separates them and Towa is thrown through a portal to modern-day Japan. There, she is found by Souta Higurashi, who raises her as his daughter after Towa finds herself unable to return to her time.
>
>Ten years later, 14-year-old Towa is a relatively well-adjusted student, despite the fact that she often gets into fights. However, unexpected trouble arrives on her doorstep in the form of three visitors from Feudal Japan; Moroha, a bounty hunter; Setsuna, a demon slayer and Towa's long-lost twin sister; and Mistress Three-Eyes, a demon seeking a mystical object. Working together, the girls defeat their foe, but in the process, Towa discovers to her horror that Setsuna has no memory of her at all. Hanyou no Yashahime: Sengoku Otogizoushi follows the three girls as they endeavor to remedy Setsuna's memory loss, as well as discover the truth about their linked destinies.

## Review
Inuyasha and Kagome finally fucked and had a child and so did Sesshomaru and his loli wife rin. Even Miroku and Sango fucked and got 3 children.

The ending song is pretty good. Basically abandoned their children because of bullshit reasons. Seems good to see more of Inuyasha, there are some really retarded reasons and the time skips in storytelling are somewhat messy but good nonetheless.
   
Next season soon 7/10
