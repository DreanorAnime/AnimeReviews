## Synopsis
>The bustling metropolis of Kansai, where cybernetic screens litter the neon landscape, may seem like a technological utopia at first glance. But in the dark alleys around the brightly-lit buildings, an unforgiving criminal underbelly still exists in the form of fugitives known as "Akudama."
>
>No stranger to these individuals, Kansai police begin the countdown to the public execution of an infamous Akudama "Cutthroat," guilty of killing 999 people. However, a mysterious message is sent to several elite Akudama, enlisting them to free Cutthroat for a substantial amount of money. An invisible hand seeks to gather these dangerous personas in one place, ensuring that the execution is well underway to becoming a full-blown bloodbath.

## Review
The real Swindler was Swindler Swindling my dick all along.

Started out really strong then fell apart after the space ship launch when they ran out of ideas. Better than average for sure but I was swindled in the end. I wanted some bigger brain swindle from Swinlder that bamboozled the Kanto AI or something. "Oh I'm just innocent hehe" was kind of lame and most people wouldn't believe her without hacker's help at the end.

Ragtag bunch of super criminals doing a heist in a cyberpunk setting while being hunted down by superhuman ninja policemen went to heist done, team dissolved, babysitting some children with a retarded dream, setting is dominated by sewer shit/dumping grounds now, superhuman ninja policemen turn out to be total jobbers exept for Master who is now dead, all the cute girls are getting turned ugly.
   
Lackluster ending 7/10
