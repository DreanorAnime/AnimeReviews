## Synopsis
>Due to poor lifestyle choices, a certain human's body is in constant turmoil. With germs, bacteria, and foreign substances abound, the jobs of various cells become increasingly difficult and dangerous. As some of the unfortunate ones who matured in this chaotic environment, Sekkekkyuu AA2153 and Hakkekkyuu U-1196 strive to fulfill their dutiesâ€”even if it means seeing many of their fellow cells lose their lives in duty.
>
>Set in an environment vastly different from its parent story, Hataraku Saibou Black portrays the cells' struggles as they try to maintain the body's health. However, the human's condition continues to deteriorate, and whether or not these efforts will amount to something concrete depends on the cells!

## Review
Big Booba white cell and soy boi red cell.

Platelets are no longer lolis nooooo, they grew up and are mean bitches now. Everything is a lie and the cells get exploited until they drop. This is a really grim version of the original show.

The sperm cells got flushed down the toilet, this is getting too real kek. The body is a fat fuck and as unhealty as one can be. After all the trials they went through and with a piece of mind in a healty body, they can transferred to a even shittier body haha.
   
White cell best cell 8/10
