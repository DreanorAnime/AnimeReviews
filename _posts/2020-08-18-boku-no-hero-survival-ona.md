## Synopsis
>In this brand-new adventure, some Class 1-A students are sent to hone their survival skills at a training course. Having yet to receive their provisional licenses, they're eager to cut loose and have a little fun.
>
>They quickly discover that the danger they face is no simulation! It's going to take their combined training, teamwork, and quick thinking if they're going to pass this assignment!

## Review
To be honest, I can't see the point of this ONA. The students of Class 1-A are sent on a training course, where they have to safe a dummy. In the beginning they said it is a race against time, but oh fuck it let's just casually walk in.

In the main series they fight against villains and have amazing fights and here they struggle and get scared of a collapsed building, wtf did I just watch? I want my time back.

   
The only redeeming point for me is the BGM which is pretty good across the series. 4/10
