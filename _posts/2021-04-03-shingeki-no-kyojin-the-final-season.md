>
>In Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season, two utterly different worlds collide as each party pursues its own agenda in the long-awaited conclusion to Paradis' fight for freedom.

## Review
We reached the endgame after almost 8 years.

Holy fucking shit, the animations look like shit when they are in human form, what the hell happened. Mikasa looks like a fucking tranny now and is ugly. The music is fitting with good OP and ED. Shame that Sasha died by the scum kids.

Things are really getting more intersting each episode. Kek Historia gets raped and breed by everyone.
   
Hype for the endgame 9/10
