## Synopsis
>Koguma, a reserved second-year high school student, has nothingâ€”no parents, hobbies, friends, or goals. On her way home one afternoon, she visits a vehicle shop in hopes of acquiring a motor scooter. With only enough money to make ends meet, she is disheartened by the price tags and prepares to turn back. However, as she is about to leave, the shop's owner offers her a pre-owned Honda Super Cub for ten thousand yen. Believing that the motorcycle will help brighten her monotonous world, she accepts the deal. As Koguma journeys through her town on small adventures with her Super Cub, she begins to build irreplaceable friendships and eagerly advances toward her new life.

## Review
Depressed loner buys a motorbike for 10.000 yen, grows balls and starts to enjoy life.

Slice of life and somewhat boring, how much are they shilling for Honda? How messed up must you be to form a relationship with a bike. Cunt fell into a river and can't get up, calls her friend instead of actual help lmao. Actually refusing to send real help kek.
