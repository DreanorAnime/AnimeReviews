## Synopsis
>The story will center on the protagonist Joro, an ordinary male high school student, and Hose, a "perfect human" who can do anything.

## Review
I don't know why but this feels so fucking annyoing to watch. The girls are so shallow and borderline retarded, this OVA is about the game they wanted to play after the main series to win over the most girls.

This is definitely a waste of time, one fucking hour for this boring ass shit. I didn't like the anime anyway and this does not a better job. Joro and Hose both try to be smart but it is just cringe. Hose is a lost case and retarded,

He rused everyone and went for the harem ending, fucked up everything and got no one.
   
If you don't like the anime you won't like this either. 5/10
