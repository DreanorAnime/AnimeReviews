## Synopsis
>This is the story of Tokisaki Kurumi that shouldn't have been told——
>
>The amnesiac young girl, Empty, who woke up in the neighboring world encounters Tokisaki Kurumi. Led by her, the place she arrived at was the school's classroom. In order to kill each other, the girls known as semi-Spirits gathered. Now then——Let's begin our battle (date).

## Review
I really like Kurumi, she is the best girl of the entire franchise.

This already hyped my up for the 4th season. It does feel a bit like a long ad for the game though. This "movie" is 24 minutes long, it is just like a normal episode, at least call it OVA.
   
Kurumi is cute 7/10
