## Synopsis
>Mitsugu Banba is a high school girl who finds meaning in donating blood. She frequently visits a blood bank to donate blood, despite being harshly treated by the nurse. One day, she encounters a beautiful girl who looks like she's from overseas at the blood bank. The pale girl looks like she's about to faint any minute, but then, she starts destroying the blood bank. The girl loses consciousness and Mitsugu takes her home...

## Review
The artstyle is something... different?

Swapping between two openings every other episode is a interesting choice. I don't know what they try to do with mentioning Fallout 4 all the time but ehh. Everyone seems to have some kind of kink.

Not worth it. It feels bland and nothing really happens, seems pointless story wise.
   
It is boring and bland 4/10
