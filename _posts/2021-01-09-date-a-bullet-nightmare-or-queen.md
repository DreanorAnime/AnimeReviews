## Synopsis
>Second part of the Date A Bullet films.

## Review
The second part of this short movie is where all the action happens and the story gets resolved.

If it wasn't obvious already, Queen is actually a part of Kurumi that she once abandoned and is now merged with her friend that she killed. In the end she killed her again and is now on a journey towards season 4 with her new found friend.
   
Kurumi is cute 7/10
