## Synopsis
>Many years have passed since humanity was driven to the brink of extinction by the sudden emergence of the unknown life forms Gadoll. Those humans that survived now dwell in a 3000m-high mobile fortress Deca-dence built to protect themselves from the Gadoll threat.
>
>Denizens of Deca-dence fall into two categories: Gears, warriors who fight the Gadoll daily, and Tankers, those without the skills to fight. One day, Natsume, a Tanker girl who dreams of becoming a Gear meets surly Kaburagi, an armor repairman of Deca-dence.
>
>This chance meeting between the seemingly two opposites, the girl with a positive attitude who never gives up on her dreams and the realist who has given up on his, will eventually shake the future course of this world.

## Review
This is like a budget version of Attack on Titan x Kabaneri.

Everything is just a game played by some cyborgs while humans are bound to the game. I like this concept, it's a nice spin on already existing themes to make it more fun. The subplot with Kaburagi in jail is pretty boring and takes away from the excitement.

There is also no real danger for the cyborgs since they can play all day long and even if they die they just get a new account to start again. Kaburagi seems like a dick to blow everything up, they just want to play their game and don't give a fuck about the human race.

Natsumes narrative purpose is to motivate Kaburagi to rebell against the system, there is no other reason for her to exist, she is just a cog in the story machine to let Kaburagi fix everything. Other than that all other Humans are useless as fuck and server no purpose.
   
All in all pretty interesting and it has some good BGM at times 8/10
