## Synopsis
>Daisuke Kanbe, a man of extraordinary wealth, is assigned to the Modern Crime Prevention Headquarters as a detective. It is there that he gets partnered with Haru Katou, a humane detective who values justice above all. The two are polar opposites, and their morals clash time and time again. Haru despises Daisuke for using monetary wealth to solve cases, as he believes that money isn't everything. The two will have to combine their efforts, however, to solve the mysteries that are coming their way.

## Review
Weird decision to change the intro colors and make it more bland than before, also changing the white girl to a nigger for some reason makes no sense.

The music is pretty great and the story is interesting enough for a detective anime. I just can see how this would even work, infinite money and throwing it around would destroy the entire economy. His father was pretty smart having a backdoor into the AI system for anything that might happen.

Not sure if distributing the smartest AI to the entire world is a good idea. Other than that solid show.
   
Everything is over the top and solved by money 7/10
