## Synopsis
>Sakurai Shinichi's one wish is for a little peace and quiet. But Uzaki Hana–his boisterous, well-endowed underclassman–has other plans. All she wants is to hang out and poke fun at him. With the help of her chipper charm and peppy persistence, this might just be the start of a beautiful relationship!

## Review
Flesh fangs are fucking disgusting. Uzaki is pretty cute for a dumb girl and overly happy. She makes a nice wife and can even cook.

Uzakis mom watches too much daytime dramas and is a dork in the same vein as her daughter. I also didn't expect to see Kitaro and his yokai friends. Hopefully next season will show a bit more romance between Uzaki and Sakurai the few moments there were are nice.
   
Nice to watch, has some funny moments 8/10
