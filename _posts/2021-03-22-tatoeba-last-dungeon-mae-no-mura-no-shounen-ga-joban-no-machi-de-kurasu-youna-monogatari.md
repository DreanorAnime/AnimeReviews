## Synopsis
>A long time ago, the ancient saviors of Mankind founded a village as their haven, with their descendants said to assist Mankind in times of extreme chaos. This village, Kunlun, is located just beside the infamous "Last Dungeon"â€”a place where monsters of unimaginable strength reside and which serves as the hunting grounds for Kunlun residents.
>
>Despite being accustomed to defeating powerful enemies since childhood, Lloyd Belladonna regards himself as the weakest in his village in terms of magic, strength, and intelligence. Even so, to fulfill his desire of becoming a soldier, he goes to the Kingdom of Azami to enroll in its military academy. However, as someone whose upbringing defies common sense, Lloyd's innate power might just prove to be the key to end the crises enveloping the kingdom!

## Review
It is one of the unnecessary long named ones. Also fuck the universal intro.

Seems like a generic isekai story. Yandere stalker girlfriend is real. Young MC gets all the girls like always.
