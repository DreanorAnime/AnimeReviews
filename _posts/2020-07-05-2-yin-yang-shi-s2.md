Kudos to Rain Midori for doing good subs. The second season continues with the cute demon girls doing cute things. They really should never draw again though, it was a terrifying sight. 
We also get the long awaited hot spring scene, but there is a twsit. In this season we saw a more of Momoka's backstory and she is definitely the best girl in my eyes. girl.
There are some new characters and even more voice actors from JoJo.
  
Cute girls are cute 8/10.
