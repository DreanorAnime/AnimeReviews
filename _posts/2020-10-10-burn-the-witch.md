## Synopsis
>Historically, 72% of all the deaths in London are related to dragons, fantastical beings invisible to the majority of the people. While unknown to most, some people have been standing up to these dragons.
>
>Only inhabitants of Reverse London who live in the hidden "reverse" side of London can see the dragons. Even then, only a selected few become qualified enough as witches or wizards to make direct contact with them.
>
>The protagonists of the story are witch duo Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole. They are protection agents for Wing Bind (WB), an organization for dragon conservation and management. Their mission is to protect and manage the dragons within London on behalf of the people.

## Review
Dragons all look weird here, even a dog with bat wings is considered a dragon. The big black one got his face chopped off and as a long ass tongue.

The coomer fag is only thinking about Noel's boobs and is useless. He only serves as a plot device to attract more dragons and more dangers. His existence is honestly pointless apart from that.

Looking around I only see fags that are seething because their favorite author created this pile of shit. At least the dragons are somewhat interesting and nuking half the city with one wing flap.
