## Review
The last season of the autistic teen romcom.

This is even more autistically dramatic than the 2nd Season. This whole season has been nothing but it pounding into your head about love triangles and codependency. Definitely paid off for the people that stuck around with this series for the rom of the romcom part though.

Season 1 is the best, Season 2 was meh, Season 3 was a waste of time(best girl won) but it was a whole lot of nothing. Their children will be autistic as fuck and there is nothing they can do about it.
   
Only took 3 seasons over 7 years to say "I love you" 6/10
