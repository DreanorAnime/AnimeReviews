## Synopsis
>The second season of Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu.
>
>Diablo is back! You know…the Demon Lord from another world? Traveling through the woods with Rem and Shera, they encounter a lone girl in tatters, pursued by a powerful Paladin.
>
>You know what that means—Diablo will have to try and hide his lack of social skills once again (and come to her rescue, of course). Let the enchanting adventures continue!


## Review
The opening song is pretty meh.

Other than that it was a pretty good continuation from the first season. Some lewd scenes here and there, the robot maid was cute as well.
   
The end? 8/10
