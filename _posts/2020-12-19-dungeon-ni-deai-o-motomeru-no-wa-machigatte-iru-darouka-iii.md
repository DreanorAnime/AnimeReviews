## Synopsis
>The adventurers challenge the unknown, as the frenzy of the Gods reaches its peak.Orario, the labyrinth city, and the most exciting place in the world. At its center sits an abyss filled with chaos, treasure, and glory: the “Dungeon”. And in the depths of that abyss, a new monster is born.“Where… am I?”The labyrinth city is in an uproar over something it’s never seen before: a dragon girl that speaks human language. Man and monster. Old values and ways of thinking are destroyed, as the time comes for adventurer Bell Cranel and the goddess Hestia to make a decision. The story of a boy challenging the mysteries of the Dungeon, as written by a goddess, will be told… Their Familia Myth.

## Review
Interesting direction this season is going in. There are some intelligent monsters that can talk and the loli one is adorable.

The entire arc got pointless pretty quickly and basically nothing changed to before. Monsters are still monsters and hated, the gods are mostly cucks and have retarded motives.
  
Nothing ever changes 6/10
