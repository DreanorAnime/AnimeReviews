## Synopsis
>Eccentric and blunt, the walrus Odokawa lives a relatively normal life. He drives a taxi for a living, and there he meets several unique individuals: the jobless Kabasawa who is dead-set on going viral, the mysterious nurse Shirakawa, the struggling comedic duo "Homo Sapiens," and Dobu, a well-known delinquent.
>
>But Odokawaâ€™s simple way of life is about to be turned upside-down. The case of a missing girl the police have been tracking leads back to him, and now both the yakuza and a duo of corrupt cops are on his tail. Set in a strangely familiar city filled with unusual individuals, Odd Taxi is a bizarre story about a humble taxi driver and the mystery of a lost high schooler.

## Review
Interesting story. Everything was a lie all along. There never were any animals, Odokawa just had brain damage and perceived everyone as animals.

In the end the Llama turned into a cute girl. Now I kinda wanna see how everyone looks like in their human form. Thank god they actually showed them all in the end, otherwise it would've left a bad impression.
   
Cute Llama 8/10
