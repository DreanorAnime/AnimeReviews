First off, whoever thought that it is funny to put in random thoughts and references as well as smileys in these subs should go fuck themself. 
Why can't we have good subs that are not cringy for chinese anime? On this note fuck Mizu subs as well.  

On to the anime, it starts out pretty generic like most other chinese anime. There is a fighting tournament going on for the cultivators, the MC is way too overpowered and blasts through everything.
He then goes on to get even more powerful with a special Spiritual Art. 
The story jumps all over the place and way too fast, which is worrying. Random time skips ruin any kind of storytelling, this is really messed up.
Blue haired faggot brothers are so annoying, it is unbearable. Maybe I am just salty but the subs really drag down the enjoyment of watching.
  
I rate this one 4 fuck your subs out of 10
