## Review
Retarded cunt just bit into a hard egg wtf is wrong with her.

Imagine getting bullied and then wierd mysterious shit happens. Looks more like she is on drugs than anything else. Typical bitch thinks she is ugly when she is not. The whole fucking setup is retarded.

The animations look good but that is almost everything to it, the story is shit and seems like a anti bully campaign, these pretentious fucks should just end themself, it is not enjoyable to watch and boring. No one gives a fuck about that. The only reason this is high in score is because people related to it being little bitches.
   
anti-suicide propaganda the anime 3/10
