Uff, one of the few korean ones, it really sounds weird listening to it after so long. What the hell is even going on? The story is just garbage and not worth watching for, the only redeeming point I see in this is how good the art looks.
Seems like that is the only thing Korea can do right.  

It just feels really boring to watch the fights and the conversations between the characters, everything just seems way too bland for my taste.
Apparently it is better if you play the game, but be honest who the fuck wants to play some shitty korean mobile game, we are here for anime and not mobile games, no wonder it is hated so much.
Maybe it would've been better if it didn't start in the middle of some story arc. Best girl is Ara because she is a kitsune.
   
Makes no fucking sense 3/10
