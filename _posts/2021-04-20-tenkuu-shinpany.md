## Synopsis
>Upon witnessing a man's head cracked open with an axe, 16-year-old Yuri Honjou trembles in fear and confusion as she flees from the masked assailant, only to find out she's trapped in an abandoned building where every door is mysteriously locked. Desperately searching for a way out, Yuri runs to the rooftop, but a world with no signs of life stands before her, surrounded by high-rise buildings. Though filled with despair, once she learns that her brother is also in this strange place, Yuri is determined to find him and escape.
>
>However, she soon finds that there are more masked murderers in the area, anxious to terrorize their newfound victims and satiate their sickest desires, leaving Yuri to question if they will be able to make it out alive.

## Review
Opening song EMPiRE / HON-NO is nice.

High school girl kills masks and has lots of fanservice in the form of pantie shots. The setting is interesting. Has the same feeling as Satsuriku no Tenshi just in a lighter more comedic setting.
   
Season 2 when 8/10
