## Synopsis
>Based on a mixed media project that blends fantasy, magical girl, and idol elements, Lapis Re:LiGHTs will follow a group of students as they train to become idols. Together, they'll use the magic of music and the magic of... well, literal magic... in their performances.

## Review
I usually hate Idol stuff, but this looks kinda promising with magic and less typical idol activities. First few seconds already got ruined by that fucking universal logo.

Nevermind. It is the default idolshit with horrendous CGI dance parts which are a big turnoff, also everyone is gay since it is a all girls academy. Even the OP is shit, most of the songs are nothing special as well. Watching this with the Funimation subs is also weird, they are translating -san as miss, fuck these subs.

All the girls represent almost all the usual stereotypes, best girl might be Kaede, not too sure. The characters are bland and the plot is boring and lackluster. For a Idol show that focuses on singing it lacks that part a lot, there is at most 2 minutes of CGI dancing with singing per episode which is just too short.
   
Idolshit meets mahoushoujoshit 3/10
