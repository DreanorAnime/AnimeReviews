## Synopsis
>In the year 2015, more than a decade has passed since the catastrophic event known as Second Impact befell mankind. During this time of recovery, a select few learned of beings known as the Angelsâ€”colossal malevolent entities with the intention of triggering the Third Impact and wiping out the rest of humanity.
>
>Called into the city of Tokyo-3 by his father Gendou Ikari, teenager Shinji is thrust headlong into humanity's struggle. Separated from Gendou since the death of his mother, Shinji presumes that his father wishes to repair their shattered familial bonds; instead, he discovers that he was brought to pilot a giant machine capable of fighting the Angels, Evangelion Unit-01. Forced to battle against wave after wave of mankind's greatest threat, the young boy finds himself caught in the middle of a plan that could affect the future of humanity forever.

## Review
This is boring and a retelling of the original plot. There is not a single reason to watch this period. Fuck this movie and fuck all recap movies. Even the rebirth part makes no sense since there is the End of Evangelion Movie.
  
Moneygrab and milking the series 3/10
