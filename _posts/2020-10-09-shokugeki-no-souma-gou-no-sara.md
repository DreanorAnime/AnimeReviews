## Synopsis
>In the heated final season of Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma, Yukihira Soma and the Totsuki Academy compete in The Blue!

## Review
They act like being a underworld chef is equal to being a drug dealer. Sounds overbearing and lame. The fucking tranny group should commit suicide holy shit is that cancer, as if niggers weren't enough for this show.

The black robed KKK gets defeated my food and everyone gets naked again, after five seasons of the same shit it kinda gets boring to see it over and over again. Noir is also pretty weak as a underworld organization.
   
Soma x Erina when? 7/10
