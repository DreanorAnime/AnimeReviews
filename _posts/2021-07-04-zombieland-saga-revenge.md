## Synopsis
>Second season of Zombieland Saga.

## Review
Tae is still best girl and single handedly carries the entire show. Milf zombie is not bad either bad Tae is still the best.

Some songs are good, otheres are not, feels some songs are good I think I liked the first season better than this one. Tae saves everyone by paying their debt with gambling and winning 20 million.
   
Tae UwU 6/10
