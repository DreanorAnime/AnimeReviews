This blog mostly will be about short recaps/reviews of everything that aired each season. I watched over 2800 different anime at this point and I'll likely never stop.

I used [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/dreanor) in the past but ever since they fucked up their API, I switched over to [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/users/Dreanor/) with automatic sync to MAL. The main issue with MAL is that it is no longer supported by [Taiga](https://taiga.moe/) due to MAL's shit tier API.

I created a Seasonal tool for Kitsu called [Kitsu Seasons](https://github.com/DreanorAnime/Kitsu-Seasons)
